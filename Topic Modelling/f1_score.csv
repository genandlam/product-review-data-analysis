I bought this screen protector for my Note 2 since I really liked it on my Note 10.1. I'm a bit disappointed in it. My first application was fine for about a week or two; then it developed a couple of bubbles I couldn't get to go away. Because of that; I replaced it with a new one. The second one has been on for about 2 weeks now and I have found it scratches very; very easily and is now also developing bubbles that are not around the scratches areas. I like the idea of this screen protector; but not sure I would recommend it.,1,1,1,,,,,,,
this product is a little bulky; but it does the job well when my wife and I are on the road and both of the iPhones or the iPads need charging.,4,4,1,,Legend,,,,,
I was surprised on how well this was designed.  It makes you wanted know what the true costs are when for $5 I received this nice product.  This is a simple very well thought out mount.  The shaft is thick; solid and stay where you put it.  If you use it vertically; there are to small wings that hold the bottom of the phone as well the 2 easy to see side grabbers.  When horizontal; the wings fold out of the way and the grabbers do the job.  I have a 5&#34; phone; the grabbers expand larger than needed; then just squeeze them together and you'll hear the ratchet lock them in place.  To release just press the button the back.  I will make one suggestion; the phone mounts to the base by sliding on in one direction.  It's really simple to do but if there is a weak spot; it's there.  If you're not thinking you could fight this mount and break it.  After all; it is plastic.,0,2,0,,0,bluetooth/sound/speaker,,,,

"I've tried a variety of ""sport"" Bluetooth headphones; but the GOGroove BlueVIBE F1T is the first I've used with this ""back of the head"" band configuration and it works quite well. One problem I often have with earbud-type headphones is that they don't stay in my ear. Here; the band exerts enough pressure to keep the earbuds pressed into my ears; so they don't fall out and I get reasonably good sound. I do have a rather large head; so an issue I often have is having headphones be too tight. The F1T was somewhat tight; but it didn't bother me. What I did find; though; was that the neck band would brush up against my shirt collar and move it around a bit. The earbuds themselves swivel a bit for a better fit; and this works well. The manufacturer sent me the headphones and asked me to review them.Pairing the F1T was simple - only one device at a time can be paired. There are three control buttons on the right side; power and up/down. On many Bluetooth headphones I find the controls difficult to find and reach; but not here. The center power button; larger than the others; controls most of the functions you'd use on a regular basis. I was a bit concerned; reading in the instructions; that different durations of pressing the button meant different things; but it beeps briefly at the 3-second mark; used for activating voice dialing with a phone; to let you know to let go. If you hold it longer; it shuts down.The up/down buttons will change volume or; if held down; change tracks. The power button pushed briefly is pause/play. In phone mode; a single press of the power button answers; a longer press sends to voicemail. The three-second press activated Siri on my iPhone. Sound quality wasn't the best I've heard; with considerable distortion on both sides of the conversation; but it's no worse than most Bluetooth headphones of this sort. When playing music; sound quality was ok for Bluetooth; but I've heard better.One problem I often see is inadequate Bluetooth range; but not here. I could get 10 feet or so away from my phone before the sound started to break up. Unlike another set I tested recently; putting my hand up to the right ear (where the receiver is) did not cause the signal to be lost.I don't particularly care for the F1T's charging solution. A C-shaped end of the cable slides up one earpiece to make contact with pins in the headphone; but there is no positive stop to the position and it's easy to push the cable on too far and miss the charging pins. The charging/activity LED is hidden in the plastic and not easy to see.",0,0,1,,Confusion Matrix,,,,,
Didn't work.  Returning it.  Very disappointed.  Provided no charge whatsoever after charging itself overnight.  choose something else.  I had high hopes,4,4,1,,,0,1,2,4,
First thing I did was contact Lifeproof to see if the serial number was real or counterfeit. This IS a REAL lifeproof case. The numbers match for full warranty. The case looks to be well built and it passes the waterproof test. I bought this for my sons 15th birthday and he loves it!,2,1,0,,P_0,3,0,1,0,4
I bought this screen cover alongside a gel case for my M8 because I wanted to make sure that my screen; as well as the phone body were protected.Now whenever I put one of these things on a phone or electronic device I feel like someone concentrating on which wire to cut to disarm a bomb.. It's usually pretty tough for me to get these things lined up right; with no dust or particulates under the film and no bubbles. In fact; I had to throw away the first screen from this pack because there was dust underneath the film and I couldn't get it out without taking the cover all the way off; so I cut my losses and started over with a new one.Miraculously; I got the second one on; lined up and with no dust underneath it! From there on it was simple. This shield is great for removing air bubbles trapped underneath it. It took minimal effort to get them out. I just used the included card to smooth the air bubbles out and BAM; screen protected.I like these screen protectors because they are clear; they don't give the screen a dull matte finish look. They don't change the feel of the screen; and honestly; it's hard for me to tell that it's even on there.I would recommend these covers to anyone that wants to protect their phone screen from damage; and not change the look or feel of their phone too much.. Like I said; I can't even tell that it's on there most of the time. And as an added plus; these are pretty easy to apply. If I can get one on correctly; ANYONE can!,1,1,1,,P_1,0,6,0,0,6
I've never tried tempered glass for my phone before so wanted to get better screen protector than an usual film so tried and loved it.First; tempered glass screen protector is much easier to put than film protector.Second; protects better...how do I know this?;Actually dropped my phone from higher than five feet; and phone landed on face side.Only shattered tempered glass; but nothing happened to screen...,1,1,1,,P_2,0,3,2,1,6
First I want to say that this is a package design that looks good on a store shelf and that's fine with me. It's hard to get into but I'm not minding that a bit since this product delivers the goods.This is an expensive headset; so I had high expectations for it.Included in the package are two extra sets of eargels; a USB cable; charger and instructions. There is another version of this available; the Jabra UC Plus Jabra MOTION UC with Travel & Charge Kit MS JABRA MOTION UC PLUS BT HEADSET WITH TRAVEL KIT FOR MICROSOFT LYNC Mono - Wireless - Bluetooth/NFC - 328.1 ft - Behind-the-ear - Monaural - Outer-ear - Noise Filtering Microphone.This is fairly simple to operate. Flip down the mic to turn it on and sync it with your phone. When you pull the mic down; you can turn it to set it the way you want for either ear; and adjust the length of the little mic arm to the exact position you want.On the back of the earpiece is a touch sensitive slider to set the volume. This is next to the USB charger port. There is a tiny button which can be pressed to control the Jabra software for tasks susch as checking the battery charge; searching your contacts; etc.There is a large main call button to control your phone and make calls.There is NFC pairing to your phone; or you can simply press the small button and say &#34;pairing&#34; and you will be taken to Pairing mode.There is an app you can download on your phone to show battery strength; settings to office; car; and outdoors to best detect your voice in various environments; using noise cancelation technology.I could hear others during phone calls perfectly and they could hear me.I find this very comfortible to wear even for extended periods of time. This is lighter in weight than the comparable Plantronics unit; which uses a proprietary charging port rather than the ubiquitous micro USB port this uses.In short; this is extremely comfortible; extremely lightweight and extremely easy and pleasant to use. I love the use of the voice commands; the music streaming ability; the way the volume scrolls easily; and the way it works flawlessly for everything.Jabra has done a great job with this one; and yes; it's worth the price.,0,0,1,,P_4,0,0,0,4,4
Verizon charger for the HTC Incredible. Works well. Don't buy a non Amazon product. Too many of the generic chargers can damage your phone. This one is inexpensive because Verizon is no longer selling the HTC Incredible but have gone to the Iincredible II. The Incredible is still a first rate 3G phone if you don't want to break the bank.,4,4,1,,,3,9,3,5,
Just like the original and works great; ordered it because my other chargers wouldn't work on my HTC Evo 4g and this one worked ! Good product good price,2,2,1,,,,,,,
The look and feel is great a little bit on the flimsy side but doable just need to be extra careful. The sound quality is great I give it 8 out of 10 they are lightweight and have really great battery timeand the distance for Bluetooth is amazing,0,0,1,,Precision_0,0.75,Recall_0,1,F1_0,0.857142857
This skin is really strong. It was tricky to put on at first but once I got the gist of it; it wasn't so bad. I pulled it off several times and even though it stretched; it did not break or leave a crease. The only reason why I'm giving it a 4 star is because it does not have coverings for the sides. It shouldn't be very hard to do; you just come up with a mold and you're good to go. The price is excellent! I used to pay $14+ for a great skin. This is much cheaper; but I had to wait a little longer for it in the mail. No biggie; I knew about it before I bought it.,2,1,0,,Precision_1,1,Recall_1,0.666666667,F1_1,0.8
"I have purchased this to charge my new Nexus 4. This charging pad does not include the power supply; only the USB cable; so I thought I'd just use the included power supply which came with Nexus 4. However; the Nexus 4's power supply is rated at 1.2A and this plate requires a 1.5A power supply - when used with this power supply the ""charging"" light is blinking in red color regardless of how I position the phone on this pad. Luckily I had a spare iPad power supply which worked perfectly with it - the ""charging"" light was blinking in green color during charging; like it should. I dunno if it is a problem with the original power supply included with Nexus 4 (I cannot measure its actual current); the pad itself or the phone but it's just something you should be aware of.",4,4,1,,Precision_2,0.333333333,Recall_2,0.666666667,F1_2,0.444444444
It's diffently worth the price.  Most cases are $15 and up.  I love the design as well!  Recommendations are in order!,2,1,0,,Precision_3,1,Recall_3,0.8,F1_3,0.888888889
