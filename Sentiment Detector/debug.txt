reviewText: I used the Motorola H500 before and the sound clarity is not as good as the Jabra BT250v. So I bought this product June 30 to replace my H500. Received it July 11th. The person in the other end of the line noticed that I sounded clearer and louder. Used it while driving to test sound clarity and it passed. My Jabra250v was just used for minutes of light usage (3 hours max in 7 days), but the headphone stopped working August 15. The person on the other line can hear me fine, but I don't hear anything from the headset. I asked Amazon for a refund or replacement, but Al from from customer service emailed me this, "Unfortunately, more than 30 days have passed since you received this item, and we are not able to provide a replacement. Our return policy states that within 30 days of delivery of your order, you may return any merchandise in new condition, with the original packaging and accessories, or any defective merchandise, for a full a refund or replacement. " Fair enough.He gave me a phone number to the Jabra corporation: 619-622-0764&lt;---this number does not work. So I had to go to the Jabra website and ask them for a replacement and or refund. As of August 17 12:54am EST, I have not heard anything from the company.This could be an isolated case. And for a good brand name like Jabra, I hope it is. But it sucks when you get a faulty piece of equipment. I hope you have a better experience with this product than what I have experienced. Just do know that this product is not free from possible defects.

reviewText: The range on the headset was pathetic - maybe 2 or 3 feet from the phone to get a decent signal (which defeats the entire puprpose of a CORDLESS headset IMHO).  Otherwise, it was horrific - static, terrible sound quality, etc.  Please do not waste money on that POS.  I swapped it out for the Moto H850 and am much happier with that unit paired up with my MotoE815.

reviewText: I believe becuase of the boom it tends to "flap" around more so then the likes of say H500 hands free, but that only seems awkward when you have fast head movement, otherwise not a problem. Will not fall off, barely notice it is there, very comfortable, unlike the H605 I tried. The volume is not a problem, loud enough and callers can hear my whispers, I did crank the volume to full. Loud enough but I feel that the H605 I tried was louder, but that is a direct in ear ear piece, but that thing was very uncomforatable so this is a excelent balance of everything, plus a neat boom to flip open and answer, I can slip this on the ear very easy. I like.Just a note, MOT once again has a different charger for this piece, it is NOT a usb connecter, but a pin connector, oh and FYI, to plug it in, it has to be upside down, read the instructions first or you may be scratching you head trying to plug in the charger.

reviewText: I bought this product few weeks back. It works really great with my Samsung t609. Once you have bluetooth enabled on your phone, everything else works smooth. It has a good voice quality. 1 Small glitch - I found that when I use bluetooth, it uses more battery power from my cell phone.

reviewText: As a long-time Motorola bluetooth headset user, I can tell you from painful experience that there are fundamental flaws in the HS850.  In fact, I went through FOUR HS850 headsets (under warranty) before Motorola decided to upgrade me to the H700 (despite the lower model number, the H700 is a newer model).The HS850 and H700 have the same characteristics:- Over-the-ear swing arm earpiece that can be used on left or right ear- Flip-open boom microphone that turns the headset on/off- Easy volume controls- Toggle switch to connect/disconnect calls (or put them on hold/mute)- Easy pairing- Good published battery life- Standard Motorola power connectorsWhat's the difference?  Well, "good published" battery life is the distinction.  All four of the HS850 headsets worked for a few weeks or months, but then would not hold a charge.  Battery life went down to MINUTES.Dealing with Motorola support was a nightmare.  Apparently, their support center for these products was in Argentina, and they could only do what was in their script to help me.  After the fourth failure, I insisted on getting a support contact at their corporate HQ in Illinois.  That support contact was a dream.  After reviewing my case, he gave me the H700 as a replacement.  I had that headset for 1.5 years, and it had kept its battery life and functionality.  Of course, I lost it and had to buy a replacement...and given all the choices, I got another H700.Do NOT fall for the lower price of the HS850.  I've seen prices as low as $15 for this model.  I think you'll be frustrated and disappointed in the end.

reviewText: When it comes to headsets, the sound quality is the bottom line for me. I'm sorry to say that this one doesn't have it. I found the function excellent and especially liked the folding boom mike. The fit was a bit loose but not a huge problem. The big issue for me was the muffled sound, both for me and the caller. The other problem is that in a noisy environment holding a conversation became a real problem. I have tested 8 different headsets by pairing two of them at a time, putting one in each ear, and switching between them during a call. This lets me and the caller make a reasonable comparison of sound quality. Only one of the other 7 I tested did worse. (I also tested the Motorola H700 and found it to have the same pros and cons as this one.)

reviewText: IMHO this is slightly better than the Moto H700.  It's larger, and a bit heavier.  The boom is larger.  But if that's not an issue, then both are equal IMHO.  Both have the cheek problem!Now for the problem where people cannot hear you, or you sound muffled or away from the phone.  Wearing your bluetooth, look in the mirror and see how the boom touches your cheek or if you have a beard it'll touch that.  Note there is a very small hole on the inside of the boom that gets the sound.  Now anything that touches that will impede your voice....it's like putting a towel over a regular phone and talking to someone. Not you do not need puffy cheeks for this problem to happen.  Unless you have a very narrow face, chances are this will happen to you and you'll blame it on the bluetooth!TO fix this, get either Neoprene tubing or that sticky foam on one end (mole skin) and cut a small piece and put on the hinge near the boom then a smaller piece (if needed) on top of the other.  This will make a space between your cheek and the boom so people can hear you! With this fix, you will still be able to close your boom.

reviewText: This headset generally works, though there was times I needed to re-pair it. My problems with it that are:1) Its hard to turn off - if you pay attention you can turn it off easy enough, but nothing like the Motorola H700 where you just flip the boom.2) It's big! It's comfy enough on your ear, but its huge in your pocket and since things stick out of it, its hard to get out of your pocket.3) Flashing blue light is way too bright! When is dark and I'm in the car, I keep thinking that the cops are behind me the way it blinks so brightly. It disturbed my passengers too.4) Wind tolerance - it's better than my H700, but its still too noisy to hold a conversation in any level of wind.I'm sending mine back and getting another H700.

reviewText: Pros:* I love the fit. Very balanced and hard to lose while working out. A big plus over the Motorola H700 I had before that was always falling off. This is significant because this is a replacement for the H700 I lost jogging in the rain.* Outbound voice quality is reported superior to my old Motorola by my friends.* Incoming sound is as good as the Motorola and actually a bit better when you account for the fit to ear seal.Cons:* Claims of 6 hours of talk time are greatly inflated.  More like 3 right off the charger. This is a problem. Now I need a car charger for it.* Too many buttons and not intuitive. Not responsive sometimes to commands. Sluggish switching.* The ear pieces cost you a certain amount of ambient hearing of your environment. Whatever size you use, it still really cuts down on your hearing of the world around you on that side. Compared to the "floppy" Motorola, this is extreme. The Motorola had no impact on hearing that I would notice.The talk time is my biggest complaint. The rest is just nitpicking.

reviewText: I got this because I used Plantronics headsets at work and love the quality + the price was awesome. This solves the main purpose of the bluetooth - to enable handsfree conversation with quality audio. The voice quality is very good - people hear me very clearly and I too hear them clearly (at times, the volume seems to be a bit low but I do not know if it is because the other side is not speaking close into the phone or it is a problem with this). Pairing with the iPhone was a breeze. You can pair with 2 devices at the same time (I tried 2 phones, but I would like to add a phone and my laptop so I can take softphone calls on my laptop without an extended headset).I noticed that it disconnects from the phone after some time (less than an hour) of non-use. The first few days, I was always powering it off and on to re-establish the connection or going to the phone settings to reconnect and I was going to return it; however, one day I wanted to try pressing and holding the talk button for 2 seconds and bingo - it reconnects. So I don't have to power it off/on to reconnect.I am not sure if this is a feature of the iPhone or this device but I love the Voice Control - I press the talk button for 2 seconds to activate the Voice Control on my iPhone and I can say the number or name I want to dial and it dials for me. So now I am 100% hands-free while driving I use voice control all the time to dial people.I gave a 4 rating because this is not as comfortable as the Motorola H720 that I got for my wife (H720 is true over the ear headset - nothing going into your ear - you can read my review for that product on Amazon). Getting on the ear is a bit difficult - need 2 hands usually.For folks that want to listen to music from your iPhone/BBerry, please note that this headset is NOT A2DP enabled. i.e. you cannot stream music to your headset from your smartphone. If that is important for you, you can try Jabra BT8040 (I owned 8010 until I lost it, and I liked that - Plantronics or Motorola H720 voice quality was better than my old 8010 though).

reviewText: This headset was purchased to replace a Jabra BT8040.  The goal was to get a headset in which 1) people could hear me clearly and 2) I could hear them clearly.  After having this Plantronics headset for over a month, I am very pleased with the purchase so far.  With this headset, I have had no complaints that callers can't hear me or complaints of interference.  Also, I am able to hear the caller well.In researching buetooth headsets, I opted for this one based on the performance review and price point.

reviewText: The Plantronics Voyager 510 is a great headset for the right situation.  I've owned a 510 for three years, this latest one to replace the last one the dog chewed up (literally).The 510 is a comfortable headset with good battery life.  The quality of the audio I hear is very good, and the quality of the audio my callers hear is also very good.  However, the unit just returned would continuously send a low level static to callers, which wasn't the case with my prior 510.  I assume this was just a defective unit.The big strength of this headset is dealing with noise.  In comparison to the other two headsets I gave serious consideration, the Motorola H710 and the Jabra BT8040, the 510 had the best audio in all conditions.  One test was driving down the highway with all 4 windows down, the radio on at a moderate volume and the headset in the right ear.  Cabin noise was so loud that I felt the need to raise my voice level to hear myself.  I was able to hear callers over the noise just barely, and they could hear me, but did hear a lot of background noise as one would expect.  With the H710, I could hear callers well, but I was completely unintelligible to them.  The BT8040 was almost as good as the 510; callers heard me almost as well as with the 510, but I had trouble hearing callers because the audio was cutting in and out, as if echo cancellation was getting confused by all the noise.  All three worked quite well in quieter environments.  The H710 fails to cancel echo (of my voice back to me) when paired with a Uniden cordless land-line phone (with BT support).  The BT8040 fails to pair with the Uniden cordless phone at all.I ultimately kept the BT8040 and returned the 510 because of some shortcomings of the 510.  First, it is tricky to get on and off.  It took me a long time to figure out how to put it on using one hand, and it takes some fumbling.  It's far easier and faster to use 2 hands to put it on, but this is a hassle, and frankly looks stupid when you're doing it.  I don't like wearing it all the time because it is big and the darn blue light flashes all the time, grabbing the attention of others around you.  I feel like I'm on exhibit when I try to wear the 510 around others.  Finally, the 510 is not a good shape for keeping it in your pocket, and it's large enough that the phone and the headset in the same pocket isn't usually workable.  Which brings us back to the dog and the chewed up headset.  Because of its poor pocketability, I would tend to leave it on the desk or table when not in use.  Doggie finally figured this out.For use exclusively as a car or office headset, I'd pick the 510 over all three.  But for versatility in a wider range of uses, the BT8040 works best for me.

reviewText: I've been using mine for about a month and I like it.  The sound quality is high, both sending and receiving.  It came with three ear bud covers, the smallest of which is the best fit for me.  However, even that one is still a bit too large for me and I find that I occasionally need to readjust the ear piece during a conversation (otherwise I'd give this 5 stars).  I find that the controls are too small for my hands, and so I do not attempt to use them while wearing the headset.All in all it's an effective headset and an improvement over the Motorola H700 I had been using.

reviewText: This is my fourth consecutive Motorola phone. I've owned a Timeport, v66, and v600. The Timeport was simply terrible. The v66 was a little better, but the Motorola menu had to be the worst of any phone I had ever used. My v600 was a very pleasant surprise. My sleek and functional RAZR is the best phone that I have owned. I really like the large crisp screen. The tiny external screen is a great addition. After three weeks of fairly heavy use, I haven't had any problems. The RAZR has pretty good talk time, but I'm not certain whether or not one can really get the 7 hours claimed by Motorola. The feature that I really like and appreciate is the abilit to charge my phone with a standard USB cable. It's nice not having to carry around an extra charger when I'm already lugging around my laptop and its power supply.

reviewText: I'm very impressed with this headset. The set up was simple on my SE K700i phone. I just paired the two devices and added it on in handsfree mode. This headset is light and extremely comfortable in my ear. Just move the gel earpiece to the left if you use it in your right ear for additional comfort. Conversely, move the gel earpiece to the right if you use it in your left ear. It fits so well in my ear that I don't have any need to use the ear loop.The sound clarity is great. Everyone I talk to says they hear me very well. I just needed to raise the volume up a little to hear everyone perfectly. I don't hear any static whatsoever when I use this headset in my wifi and bluetooth networks at home.Plantronics gives you a lot of charging options. I use the SE charging adapter, which I snapped on at the bottom of the little pocket case, so I could use one charger for two gadgets. This headset comes with a Nokia, Samsung, Siemens and Sony Ericcson adapter for charging. The headset also comes with its own charger, in case you don't own one of these 4 phone models, which you can use in any wall outlet. I tried that method of charging and it works fine too.This headset also comes with a mobile charger case, where you use a AAA battery. I didn't try that method of charging since I have a SE car charger which works well with the included SE adapter.Voice dialing works fine. That's important to me since I'm a mobile professional who spends a lot of time traveling in my car.The headset does beep right before you make a call. It also beeps right before it signals for the name you want to call. I don't find that irritating, as one other reviewer mentioned. That's just how the headset operates. And let me emphasize that this headset works great.It is the best bluetooth headset I've ever owned.

reviewText: After reading the stellar reviews for the Discovery 640 both on Amazon and Cnet, I bought one and took off for home. After charging it up and attempting sync with my Motorola v360, I found I couldn't get it to work. I re-read the manuals for the 640 and for my v360 to see if it was me. Then I went on the web to see if I had some compatibility issue. It then occurred to me that I might have actually gotten a bad piece of electronics - which is a pretty rare occurrence nowadays. I was able to cross check the Discovery and my phone with a friend's bluetooth headset (Moto HS820 and v600) and found that the Plantronics was the culprit.Bottom line: check before you get too far from the store. Since it is usually a hassle to return items via mail order, i would only buy from a brick and mortar store.Here is a tidbit you might want to know about bluetooth chips (ICs) - they are not always fully tested! I am directly involved in the semiconductor testing industry and have been for many years. Bluetooth chips, and many other relatively low cost consumer semiconductor devices, are NOT fully tested. Instead, the lots of devices are sample tested to statistically insure that a very high percentage are "good." This is in direct contrast to higher value chips, such as Intel, AMD and PPC microprocessors, that are much more fully tested at multiple steps. The low cost nature of bluetooth chips (as well as many mp3, 802.11, etc.) really mandates the sampled test approach. For the most part, we get away with it. In the case of the unit I bought, it was not sufficient. The fact that I got a defective finished headset means that it is unlikely that Plantronics does 100% testing of its finished headset in addition to the known fact that the IC manufacturer they use is unlikely to do 100% testing. Once again, check it before you leave the parking lot.I will try one of these again as soon as they are back in stock and report on it again if I get a functional unit.

reviewText: I only purchased this phone because Cingular did not carry the new RAZR with the MP3 player and 1.3 megapizel camera so I had to settle for this one.  The swivel to use the keypad is awful, no one can ever hear me when talking, (even when I use the Motorola H700 Bluetooth headset), photos taken on a regular megapixel camera phone are better than the 1.3 provided here, can't listen to MP3 thru bluetooth, photos stored on phone often become corrupted for no reason at all, all photos disappear occassionally and I have to turn phone off and back on, too bulky and heavy, battery at times drains after only an hour even without any use, reception very poor and often have to stand in wide open areas.  Overall, I am very disappointed with this phone and only wish my contract would allow me to trade it in.  I am a gadget junkie and the reviews on CNET led me to purchase this phone but I truly now regret it.  Go with the new Motorola RAZR with the 1.3 camera and the MP3 player, same features in a nice slim package.

reviewText: sony ericsson W600 reviewupdated note: phone has been sent back to the manufacturer twice now for bluetooth problems. upon thinking about this phone some more, i'd say the software is buggy for a lot of people. please take this into consideration before buying.i bought this phone in early december for the oh-so-NOT-low price of $390 from letstalk.com. i was (am) only about seven months into my two-year contract, so yes, i paid full price. :eek:in my past, i've owned most of the major brands of phones (motorola, nokia, samsung, sony ericsson, sharp) and right before i got this phone, i was a happy motorola V551 owner. initially, i had wanted the sony ericsson W800, but without the 850mhz band and being a cingular customer, i wasn't going to risk it.in short, i love this phone. to date, it's the best phone i've owned. i don't think it's worth the $390 i paid for it, but that's really my fault. i'm impatient and wanted this phone reeeeeally bad and didn't want to wait until it dropped in price (if it ever will). i am going to cover a few of the major components to this phone and then list some pros and cons. mine is a cingular-branded phone, so keep that in mind when i talk about certain features.camera: i've had a few camera phones before this one. i'll preface this section by saying what 100s of others have said: it's a camera PHONE. it's not going to have the quality to make even a decent 4X6 print. what it IS good for are those moments where you're thinking, "oh! i wish i had a camera right now!". my last phone was a VGA camera and i thought by getting a phone with a 1.3 MP camera, it'd be a noticable difference. it isn't really. however, the cameras on phones are such a relative subject since once person can think the pic looks good and others think it looks like total doodie. i would urge you to look at samples of pics this phone has taken and judge for yourself. i wasn't too impressed, but that's not why i bought the phone. the camera has a lot of neat little options (special effects, white balance, shoot mode, night mode, self-timer, etc), but that's all kinda lost when the pictures aren't that great. it should be noted that the camera on this phone and the sony ericsson S710a (a phone very similar to the W600) are both 1.3MP, but the S710a has a CCD sensor, which results in better pics. the phone will also take little (albeit grainy) video clips. moving on...bluetooth: doesn't seem to be as easy to use as with my motorola, but i have some learning to do here. was what was cool was transferring ringtones from my friend's SE T616 to mine via bluetooth. free ringtones for me! i don't have bluetooth on any of my PCs, so i cannot comment on bluetooth connectivity in relation to that. i just like that the option (bluetooth) is there.walkman: holy crap, it's a MP3 player on my phone! the walkman is pretty easy to use and so is the software to transfer songs to your phone. it took me about 12 minutes to transfer 15 songs, so it's not incredibly fast, but it's a cool app, nonetheless. the phone can hold about 60-70 songs at 128bps (ripping at other bitrates is possible, allowing more/less songs to be stored on the phone), depending on what other stuff you have on your phone (pics, vids). the sound is pretty damn good. you can listen to MP3s from the speakers or via headphones. i was very impressed. the phone does NOT have a 3.5mm plug, but comes with an adapter, so all is well. i've even plugged this phone into my car's cassette adapter and played MP3s through the car's stereo speakers. MP3s can also be used as ringtones. all-in-all, no complaints here! well, except the 256MB limit.radio: nice little feature! you HAVE to have the headset plugged in to listen to the radio, as it acts as the antenna, but while it's plugged in, you can send the sound to come out of the speakers. radio is easy to use, channels are easy to store and radio sounds good. the radio (as well as the MP3 player), will pause if you get a call and resume when you're done. you can also use the radio and MP3 player while doing other things on the phone. headphones sound awesome.games: the phone came with six games: asphalt3D, blockbreaker, bruwnswick billiards, jewel quest, name that tune, tetris, and 3D extreme air snowboarding. all games are locked, so you can only play them for about a minute and then you are prompted to purchase them. they are $6-$8, roughly. total rip off. thanks cingular.ringtones: again, thanks to cingular, there are only six ringtones that come with this phone, and they are pretty crappy. there are free ones all over the place, so don't go spending your inheritance on buying them from cingular. or, do as i do and grab them off another SE phone via bluetooth. there is a little app including on the phone called musicDJ and you can actually make your own ringtones. kinda cool. i've made a few so far and they aren't bad. well, ok, my mom said they sounded horrible, but what does she know?syncing: this phone syncs with your contacts, tasks, notes and calendar, if you have those kinds of programs on your PC. i got my phone to sync with my outlook, which now means i'll sell my PDA. SE's PC suite works pretty well and transferring files is easy. however, it seems like every now and again, when i am connected via USB, it reboots my phone. don't know what that's about. i don't think any harm is being done.the phone feels pretty solid in your hand, weight-wise. i've never owned a slider/swivel phone in my life, and while it's not the most convenient to "flip" open, it's not bad. you can actually place and receive calls with the phone swivelled shut, too, which i liked.it seems like SE didn't leave anything out with this phone (except a memory slot) and i love it. they thought of everything on this phone: radio, little flash light, dedicated key lock button, infrared, calendar, music/video/picture DJ,stopwatch, timer, tasks, notes and the list goes on and on. the phone's styling (ie: orange cover) isn't for everyone, but i love it. my phone did come with a 2nd cover, in navy blue. it's styling and shape is great and i love the orange backlit keypad. it's definitely a head-turner.and, above all, reception and clarity of calls is great. i've had no complaints when i've used the phone, the headset, the bluetooth headset and speakerphone. it's really nice. this of course, can be dependent on your network. i live in the midwest in a fairly large area (260K people), so we have cell towers all over the place.pros:* nice size.* bluetooth, infrared and speakerphone.* radio and MP3s* clarity of calls is excellent. reception is great.* screen is nice and bright.* easy to get pics, vids, etc. on and off the phone.* phone comes with everything you need (except car charger)* this phone is loaded - nothing is left out!* sony ericsson's interface is great; apps like the address book are loaded with room for tons of info. menus are easy to use.cons:* no memory slot. on-board memory, while not bad, is limited to 256MB.* price (well, at full retail anyway).* camera is disappointing for a 1.3MP.* phone goes into standby (screen off) after 15 seconds. very annoying and to date, i've found no way to change that.* games are locked for only 1 minute of play. thanks cingular ;( not ONE free game is included.* keypad buttons are small, and close together. i have small hands, so the key size is not so bad, it's the fact that they are right next to each other.this is a great phone. its big disappointment is the fixed 256MB memory, but for a lot of people who just want to listen to a few songs and not 500, this phone will suit you just fine. i am hoping to keep this phone for more than six months (which is about how often i get a new cell phone) - it has everything i need and nothing i don't. kudos to sony ericsson for putting out a great phone! woo! ;)

reviewText: First of all I just want to say, this low cost Bluetooth headset is a great value.  There are a lot of Bluetooth heasets to choose from on the market today.  Many are more stylish and have more bells and whistles, but for under $30.00 this headset is one of the best values out there.  This pink version is very cute and offers a perfect color match for the Versizon V3 series Motorola Pink Razr.  However, I believe the gentle pink color is the only stylish element of this headset.  Take away the pink and you are left with a very generic looking earpiece.Now lets talk about performance.  The H500 couldn't be eaiser to use.  It paired with my daughter's Verizon Motorola Pink Razr in just seconds, and the button configuration of this unit makes perfect sense.  The buttons have gentle action yet offer a satisfying "click" feel when pushing them; not mushy feeling at all.  The sound quality of the speaker is quite good but not acceptional.  The voice quality of the microphone is very impressive.  When I am on the phone with my daughter, she actually sounds much better with this headset than when using the Razr phone alone.  It does tend to pickup a great deal of background noise though, so it may not be the best in noisey environments.  The H500 sits in a very stable manner on my daughters ear.  The ear hook is soft and flexible and can be worn for extended periods without discomfort.  It does not look or feel as if it will fall off your ear even when tipping your head.I am giving this headset a full 5 stars.  I do not rate the H500 so highly for its outstanding style, but rather for its simple functionality, solid performance, great build quality and overall value for the money.  You just can't get a better Bluetooth headset for under $30.00!  I highly recommend this headset for any woman that is looking for a cute color match to her Verizon Moto Razr, while also seeking a comfortable fit and impressive performance.  There may be better looking headsets out there, but you'll likely suffer penalties in cost and/or performance.

reviewText: The price of bluetooth devices has gone down dramatically that I was able to justify buying one:) The H500 works fine with our LG Shine. Although you may need to talk a little louder so that the other person can clearly understand you (Well, not too bad really).It was an easy setup. The device itself looks fine, not too dorky in my opinion. It also has a nice blue LED light. Available in many colors of choice.Why 3 stars? The volume control is hardly palpable. It is hard to adjust the volume while in use. Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust. Even the call button is difficult to press.I like the ear hook can be flipped to be used either on your left or right ear. It is also not too heavy to be worn comfortable on your ear.

reviewText: 5 stars if it fit more in the ear than on it.  There's a gap between it and the ear when it's on.  That doesn't seem to affect call quality or volume but it feels a little floppy that way.It does probably make wearing it for a long time more comfortable.  It is small enough to forget about and since your ear isn't plugged the outside noises sound like it's not there.For the problem where the mic gets blocked, I've noticed that the more horizontal I make it, the more it sits off the face.  If I turn it so that it is more vertical it moves the mic closer to the skin.  But that'll vary by user due to ear shape.Pairing with my Razr was very easy.  I tried with a V600 as well and again no problems.  Call quality is good and I can walk into the next room and still have no problems with the call.  Haven't tested the max effective range, but I can walk around the aparment and it does seem to meet specifications.  My Razr is impossible to hear in a noisy environment but if I use this headset I haven't had any problems.  Seems to be ok on the other end as well.

reviewText: This is one of the best purchases I've made on-line. The H700 is a big upgrade for me (previously used the H500). No complaints whatsoever. Love the fact I can turn off the headset by just closing it. I have a small face & small ears -- this dainty piece is perfect!

reviewText: I use this unit with my Palm Treo 700w, which has a pretty lousy BT radio, so that may explain part of the reason why the range is so awful with this headset.  Max range with clear line of sight is about 6 feet, but usually less then 24 inches.  It is barely usable if the phone is on my waist in its holster.  Major disappointment.  My Jabra BT250 is better with the Treo, but not hugely so.My biggest problem with this headset is that people are constantly telling me that they can't hear me.  I have to lift the mic boom away from my cheek and then they will say "Ah! Much better!".  When that is only the case while I stand there like a dork with one hand holding the mic boom away from my cheek and the other hand holding the phone within a foot of my head.  This looks pretty silly walking down an airport terminal, and rather defeats the purpose of having a headset in the first place...I'll say this, though - the H700 performs the feature that I was looking for which was so bad with the Jabra BT250 - it actually stays on my ear.  I have small ear lobes, and the Jabra won't stay put - if I lean down it falls off.  The H700 stays on very well, and you hardly notice it is even there.  Very comfortable!Too bad the mic gets blocked by my cheek, which makes it worthless about 50% of the time.**Update 5/11/2006**- solution to muffled sound problem...I trimmed a tiny piece of adhesive-backed felt (the kind you put under bowls/vases, etc. you will have on your coffee table)and placed it on the little gray bump on the boom, just behind the tiny mic opening. This creates an air gap between the mic opening and your cheek - problem solved!A great headset with pretty good reception and wonderful form factor. 5 stars if they fix the mic hole clearance problem!

reviewText: I've had my H700 for almost a year now, and not until recently did I learn it was a FAKE!  WOAH!  After reading the PDF on this page about how to spot a fake, I quickly learned the one I picked up on eBay was a fake.However, the headset has worked VERY well.  I compared it to a bluespoon AX7 in-ear headset, and I ended up keeping my fake H700.  Overall, it has been a very good copy, although not the real thing.  Very reliable.  However, I am still disappointed that I did not get the real headset.Is there anything I can do about this?

reviewText: I've spent the last two weeks ordering and returning bluetooth headsets.  Finally, after going through quite a few models (Motorola H350, Motorola H500, the Plantronics 655, the NX6000), I found a GREAT one.  I was willing to pay up to $150 for a headset that was comfortable, easy to use, and -- most importantly -- that my callers didn't complain about.  This headset has great sound quality on both ends, and the setup and buttons are very easy to use.  The boom folds out, and the headset turns on.  You fold it back, and the headset turns off.  Several of the headsets I tried had TERRIBLE buttons -- small and hard to work without looking in a mirror.  These are great.I was really looking forward to writing this review tonight as I'm hoping I can help someone else avoid all the research I did (CNET, endless googling) only to find this one through trial and error.Look no further, you've found a great headset!  BUY IT NOW!(and no, I don't work for Motorola!! haha)

reviewText: I previously owned an H300 and was impressed with the quality for the price.  When I lost the H300 I decided to try the H700.  I was most interested in the improved sound quality and the fit around the ear.  In those two areas the H700 is definitely an improvement over the H300.  I did not use the voice activated commands, so I cannot speak to that, but I do see where that could be useful.Overall I do see the H700 as an improvement over the H300.  My only problem with it, which is why I did not give it 5 stars, was the Bluetooth drop out.  It seems that the Bluetooth on the H700 drops out more often than the H300.  I would say that it drops out on 1 in every 20 calls.

reviewText: The H700, some love it, some hate it. Wherever you fall, a lot of people are talking about it.PRO's /  CON'sIt is comfortable and light. / Depending on the size of your face, your cheek may block the microphone resulting in muffled sound.If you are a lady with long hair that falls over your ear it will get caught in the boom microphone and snagged by the rubber tip as you flip the boom open and closed to answer calls.Distance is quoted as  up to 30 feet / Some phone combinations have distance issues if the headset and phone are not on the same side of your body.Pairs well with my Motorola Razr V3 and Cingular 8125. / Other phones and PDA's have problems SO your mileage may vary.The controls are small, multifunction (each button does may things) and are easy to access but hey, they are on the side of your head.Microphone is Very sensitive / People have complained about wind noise, echoes in rooms, and "Who else is in the car with you ?"Headset volume is loud, louder than most / Its adjustable so this is a good thing.The headset lights up in four different colors to show various status (charging, pairing, standby etc) / You can turn off the flashing blue 'I am using a fancy headset dork lamp' but it will come back on after the headset is turned off and on again.A note a caution1. This is a young product and the complaints and returns have resulted in two versions (Version A and Version B) of this headset in the market.  Version B fixes a number of problems that version A had with certain phones.2. Distance is POOR compare to other headsets and even other Motorola Bluetooth products.  I have changed my headset and Cingular has replaced the phones (Razr V3 and 8125) twice with no improvement. Distance is less than 10 feet with Static and dropped calls.  Do not expect to leave your phone in the car and pump gas or get the mail without complaints.  Some folks with the Verizon V3C Razr have reported getting better distance but few past 10 feet without the call degrading or dropping.SUPPORT3. Motorola gives you 30 days to try and return with refund, However the return shipping is ON YOU.  So with shipping / tracking / insurance expect to spend another $5 even if its their problem. If its longer than 30 days, you are stuck with it.UPDATE 6/1/06Product was returned as defective and received by Motorola 6/15. A new one was to go out 2 day FedEx. 22 Days later I received it today 7/7, NOT NEW, just a refurbished headset. NO charger, manual, case, or  warranty card.UPDATE 11/18/06Died again. Will not pair, make, or answer a call. Motorola will not send a replacement until old one is received.  No free-shipping this time.BOTTOM LINEGoogle "Motorola H700 problems", make an informed decision. If you can, try before you buy.I would give it 5 stars for Style, 3 stars for execution, 2 stars for how well it works, and 1 star for their support policy.

reviewText: Recently purchased a Razr v3.  Have tried several headsets without luck.HS805 Uses a battery, but had the best soundHS815 - OKH300 - poor - low volumeM500 - very poor - lower than the 300, beepsHS850 - good design, poor volume (again, too low) highest setting, constantly beepsPlantronics 640 - a joke, falls apart in your hand.  Little pieces everywhere.The H700 - Finally a good quality headset!  Callers have no problems hearing me...  I have no problem hearing them while on the road.  I have a quiet car, but always found myself pressing a headset into my ear in order to hear conversations.  Not the case with the H700.  This thing has volume galore!  In fact, I had to bump it down a few ticks, works great at highway speeds.  It's comfortable... (unbelievably light) you think the 850 is small....  the 700 is truly 30% smaller as Moto claims.  When closed, this thing can hide behind a .50 cent piece.  Buttons are easy to operate by feel.  Anyone who uses a headset regularly knows that adjusting opposing buttons can be challenging - Not with the H700.  There is a place top or bottom to rest a finger if you need to adjust up or down easily.  Pairing and setup took 1 minute.  Sound for me is crystal clear.  This thing has all the bells and whistles.  Works as promised right out of the box. 4 stars for design and operation.  One plug home or car fits all, 5 stars for a top notch product.

reviewText: I hear lots of static, even before making a call.  I have Motorola H500 too, and that headset has no static with my phone (Verizon LG VX8300).  This H700 has LOTS of static.  Called Motorola tech support, and their best solution is to return and replace it.  As far as usability goes, this a great headset, over the ear is more comfortable than in ear and the fit is perfect - nice and snug.  I'd keep it without any doubt if it wasn't for static noise.  While I hear static, people on the other phone can hear me fine, just as good as when I'm using H500.

reviewText: I purchased this bluetooth headset for two main reasons. First, it uses the same charger as both my Motorola Razr and RIM Blackberry 8700C. Secondly the device easily turns on and off each time you extend the microphone.I've used about 1/2 dozen other bluetooth headsets and this is one of my favorites.Here are my summarized pros and cons:PROS:-Uses the same charger as other Motorola RAZR phones-Open/Close microphone to turn headset on/off-Small, lightweight and easy to put on (one handed eve)CONS:-Only connects to one BT device at a time. I have both a RAZR and Blackberry that I carry with me everywhere. With these two devices I cannot have the H700 connect simultaneously (other Bluetooth products - notably the Plantronics) are able to connect simultaneously to two devices.I recommend this headset, and Amazon has the most competitive pricing available. Easily beating even the discount superstores where I'd seen this for 50% more.

reviewText: I recently dropped my land line and went 100% wireless for telephone service; with this change, I wanted to make sure I didn't suffer from numb arm talking on the smaller cell phone for longer periods and wanted to use a hands-free approach. My previous experiences with that were not very satisfying back in the day of earbuds and dangling wires. But, with a new cellphone came Bluetooth wireless capability, which opened up a new world of options.I had played with a number in the store, but didn't get any real world experience with them. But, I really liked the design and feel of the H700. I did some research - much of it through reviews here on Amazon; this left me a bit skeptical as there were many unfavorable reviews written here - they mentioned negatives like poor sound quality, minimum range, and Bluetooth connective problems to name a few. But, I decided to side with some other review I had read and the positive reviews on Amazon.The bottom line is I am very happy with my H700. I have experienced absolutely no problems - the people I have talked to all can hear me fine, and I can hear them; I have had the H700 up to 7 feet from my phone with no reception problems; and the H700 was easy to setup with my phone (LG VX8300) and immediately connects whenever I turn the device on.Feature-wise, the H700 is great! The buttons are easy to use and understand and the flip mic is great idea...the phone rings, just flip it open (keep it closed to conserve power) and the call is answered immediately; flip it closed to end the call and it powers down as well. The H700 also features a button for answering and ending calls if you don't want to power down the unit.I highly recommend the Motorola H700 as your Bluetooth headset choose - I have yet to find a negative about it.

reviewText: After reading some of the other reviews that were not so favorable, I was pleasantly surprised with this headset after taking advantage of a really good deal recently.  The sound quality is excellent with really impressive bass response.  Now I am pairing this with an LG VX8700 and perhaps that makes some difference.  There are some minor issues though.  Placing the phones properly on your head can mean that they are comfortable for a time, but eventually after about 2 hours they do seem to pinch. But even then it is not unbearable.  I have cycled with them, music stops when you answer and then resumes.  I have jogged with them, ear pieces pop off so you can rinse if necessary. Occasionally either the phone or the headset gets confused if you are trying to do something too fast.  Flipping through songs, and you have to re-pair the device.  Sound quality is pretty good through the microphone considering the distance.  Very slightly muffled, but still clear enough to not be a limiting factor.  A cool feature is that tap the right ear piece and it opens the music player on the phone and starts playing.  Jabra should consider putting a locking button at an appropriate location because it is easy to inadvertently push one of the many buttons when you are taking off or adjusting the phones.  Eventually you do learn how to handle to avoid this, but it is quirky.  I would so recommend this headset for those looking for something to pair with one of the newer phones that support a2d over bluetooth.  Excellent for cycling!Update 8/22/07  This headset continues to operate great, despite being dropped numerous times. As a side note, I found as I was riding today that the pairing between my lg vx 8700 was fouled as the music was intermittent.  While there is the occasional stumble in the otherwise smooth streaming, this was different.  I ended up removing the device from my 8700 and re-pairing it.  Fixed.  The only thing I can think of is that I had recently unplugged my phone while it was docked in usb mode to my pc and you are not supposed to do that without ending via the menu first.I use this headset to run with too and found a little floss can go along way.  Yep, I tied a bit of floss between the ear pieces leaving one side with a simple knot.  Then with the floss in position across the top of my head I pulled the ear pieces down until the plastic pieces which normally end up pinching the tops of the ears were just above the tops.  I then double knotted the simple knot again and voila, the floss helps support the headset while you are running and the pinching that I noted in my original review is reduced greatly.  I am actually sitting typing this listening to some Petty. Great stuff...

reviewText: After my dreadful V551, I was hesitant to return to Motorola. Since my Sony Ericsson S710a didn't work out, and since my wife's V3 has been solid so far, I decided to give Moto one more chance with the V3i.First, the build quality and materials are EXCELLENT. The machined aluminum outer casing, and machined nickel keypad, provide substantial heft (this is good) and tactility. Moto could've used a little better plastic in places, but it's fine otherwise.Second, although its resolution is lower than the S710a's, the V3i inner display's physical screen size is about the same. Meaning it's plenty large, not to mention clear, colorful, and bright. The outer display is nothing special, but it is a compromise for better battery life, so I can live with that.Third, unlike Sony Ericsson, the new Moto's (V3i, SLVR L7, etc.) sport an industry-standard mini-USB charging/data port, and use standard memory cards. (I put a 1GB TransFlash in mine and it is amazing.) No more proprietary chargers and cables, nor goofy Sony-only "Memory Sticks."Fourth, the Bluetooth. Motorola has come a long way to improve their implementation, and though it is not as full featured as Sony Ericsson's, it is almost unshakable in its stability. (Sony Ericsson has the reverse trend. The T616 had great Bluetooth, the S710a's was unstable. The new W600 and W900 are equally unstable.) Range is excellent, too.Fifth, reception and call quality are both excellent. Volume could be better, but is still adequate. I have to admit, though, that the S710a was slightly better with earpiece and speakerphone audio volume and quality.Finally, the much maligned UI. Yes, Sony Ericsson trumps everyone with their interface and Address Book; Motorola executes both of these rather clumsily, thus requiring a steep learning curve. However, two areas where Moto outshines Sony Ericsson are 1) consistent UI responsiveness and 2) broad customizability.My only other gripe is the 50 song limit in iTunes, even with the memory card upgrade. However, I'm an iPod owner, so this doesn't concern me too much.Now for a word of warning to Mac users. My iTunes-equipped V3i, unlocked and unbranded, came from an overseas market (phone and manual languages included UK English, Vietnamese, Bhasat, and Thai). It has full Bluetooth functionality with my Mac, including iSync. However, some V3i's don't work over Bluetooth - the Mac can't "see" any of the phone's services, thus preventing file transfers or iSync-ability without a USB connection. I can't say for sure if this is related to iTunes or not, but so far it seems the iTunes-loaded V3i's work better. Caveat emptor!

reviewText: Don't get me wrong the H3 looks good and sleek but it gives too much feed back. What I mean by that is that when your on the phone, the other party hears an echo.  This happend on all the calls. The only thing that kept me from returning it was that I lost the receipt and i threw away the box!  I don't recomend wasting your money on this. One you may try that has worked for me is the H500.  Cheap looks ok and best of all, it works!!!!  Oh yeah my Razor had a hard time linking to the H3.

reviewText: But you wont find a better choice at this time. The on off switch by folding the headset and the easy to push buttons make all the difference in the world.  Don't believe me, then purchase the Jabra or one of the other headsets, place it in your pocket or purse and answer a call from your phone.  Chances are you will have forgotten to turn the unit off and your caller will be live wherever you left your Bluetooth headset within 30 feet.  The H700 folds when you take it off your ear and when it folds, it turns off.  Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !!

reviewText: The H700, some love it, some hate it. Wherever you fall, a lot of people are talking about it.PRO's / CON'sIt is comfortable and light. / Depending on the size of your face, your cheek may block the microphone resulting in muffled sound.If you are a lady with long hair that falls over your ear it will get caught in the boom microphone and snagged by the rubber tip as you flip the boom open and closed to answer calls.Distance is quoted as up to 30 feet / Some phone combinations have distance issues if the headset and phone are not on the same side of your body.Pairs well with my Motorola Razr V3 and Cingular 8125. / Other phones and PDA's have problems SO your mileage may vary.The controls are small, multifunction (each button does may things) and are easy to access but hey, they are on the side of your head.Microphone is Very sensitive / People have complained about wind noise, echoes in rooms, and "Who else is in the car with you ?"Headset volume is loud, louder than most / Its adjustable so this is a good thing.The headset lights up in four different colors to show various status (charging, pairing, standby etc) / You can turn off the flashing blue 'dork lamp' but it will come back on after the headset is turned off and on again.A note a caution1. This is a young product and the complaints and returns have resulted in two versions (Version A and Version B) of this headset in the market. Version B fixes a number of problems that version A had with certain phones.2. Distance is POOR compare to other headsets and even other Motorola Bluetooth products. I have changed my headset and Cingular has replaced the phones (Razr V3 and 8125) twice with no improvement. Distance is less than 10 feet with Static and dropped calls. Do not expect to leave your phone in the car and pump gas or get the mail without complaints. Some folks with the Verizon V3C Razr have reported getting better distance but nothing past 15 feet.3. Motorola gives you 30 days to try and return with refund, However the return shipping is ON YOU. So with shipping / tracking / insurance expect to spend another $5 even if its their problem, and there are problems with this headset.If its longer than 30 days, you are stuck with it.I would give it 5 stars for Style, 3 stars for execution, 2 stars for how well it works, and 1 star for their support policy.Google "Motorola H700 problems", make an informed decision. If you can, try before you buy. $100 May Not buy you the best, maybe just the smallest. I am waiting on Motorola to replace it one last time.UPDATEProduct was returned and received by Motorola 6/15. A new one was to go out 2 day FedEx.22 Days later I received it today 7/7, just the headset. NO charger, manual, case, or  warranty card.Dead as a door nail with no charger to check it.  After 30 minutes on hold they will now replace the Whole product as ordered and returned #98686H. Would not refund shipping charges.  For those contemplating a replacement make sure they send out the latest headset part # SYN1311B.Remember a company is as the sum of its parts, support 0 stars.

reviewText: I saw the reviews for this headset on CNET, and I was pretty excited about getting it to use with my LG VX-9400 phone.  The Verizon sales agent recommended it to me because they H700 had the same version of bluetooth.  That was the reason she gave for my Jabra BT350v having lots of static when using with the 9400.Well, the results with the H700 were actually worse.  The callers on the other end said that the static was painful to their ears it was so bad.  I heard some static on my end which has never been the case with any headset phone pairing that I've had.  After one day, I boxed it back up and sent it back to Amazon.One thing to note.  This must be taken in the context of the phone it was paired with.  If you are not using the LG VX-9400, your experience will likely be different.  If at all possible, find a headset that others have already used with your phone and have reported success with.  Otherwise you are rolling the dice.  Sites like Howard Forums (Google it) are good for finding out what others have experienced.  Good luck!

reviewText: The GoodThis program can be great. I use it to sync my phone with Outlook 2003, to transfer pictures and video to my phone and to create ringtones from my favorite audio CD's.It works great with Outlook 2003, I am running Windows XP Home Edition.  I am not sure about Mac users.  It works best when you use a data cable.My Motorala Phone Tools software was purchased a couple of years ago for my Motorola V660. My toddler tossed my phone into the full washing machine while I was adding fabric softner to a load of laundry. They don't still make my old phone, my insurance replaced it with a V3.I lost my ringtones and address book. My husband already had a data cable for the V3 phone so I just plugged my phone in hoping it would allow me to sync with outlook(He took his data cable to work but I found a replacement on Amazon for less than $5.00). Imagine my surprise when the software recognized a new phone promped me to update the software to Phone Tools 4.0 and install a profile for the new phone. All I had to do was copy all my old information on to my new phone and go.The BadThis does not work on every Motorola Phone.  If you want to be sure it will work with your phone then I suggest you go to the BVRP/Avanquest website and check to see if your phone is compatable before you purchase the software.  It is cheaper at Amazon and you get the disk if you need to reinstall the program both pluses when buying this software.Not a one size fits all program;  if you want something just for Ringtones I would suggest Ringtone Media Studio 2 also by BVRP/Avanquest.The UglyThe bluetooth just does not work well and when I tried to use it it was just plain frustrating so I subtracted one star.  Bluetooth had been out long enough for them to make this work.I am not a techie I just want technology to work for me with as little hassle as possible - I'm busy I just want it to do what it should and I am happy this program still works for me two years and one phone later.

reviewText: After getting myself a new VX8700, I picked up a new VX8300 for my girlfriend. The VX8300 is not the prettiest or thinest phone Verizon offers, but it seems to be one of their best performers. Sound quality, speakerphone, RF, and battery life all seem very good. The camera takes decent pictures. It has just about all the features you expect in a phone today too. With a new contract, you can get it for $50 or less. At this price, I give it 5 stars.

reviewText: So far I'm pretry impressed with this unit. This headset is currently paired with a Blackberry 8800.Pros -1) Audio - ...is stellar. Yes, its prone to interference, but I've yet to see a unit that doesn't occasionally give you a bit of static (JX10 - I'm looking at you!). Callers were impressed to hear that I was using a headset.2) Pairing - I've always thought this process to be a bit obtuse, but I guess it drives down costs to have the much-vaunted "multi-funtion" button. I find it annoying. That said, pairing was quick and easy with this unit and it **stays** paired for hours at a time.3) Fit - Stays paired and stays in my ear for hours at a time. Does it hurt? Heck, even my ears can't stand canalphones. I stand at 6 feet and yet I have the earcanals of a 5 year old, I guess. I don't have a problem using this set all day, but my ears are still a bit sore. Still, this is much better than other models I've used (JX10 - I'm still looking at you!). For the record, I'm using the smallest gel. The WEP200 gives you three different sizes.4) Price - one of the cheapest BT headsets around. I've tried expensive, I've tried cheap, I've tried middle of the road. So far, the WEP200 beats em all, even when not factoring in the cost.5) Range - doesn't matter what side of my body this unit is on, it almost always makes a clear connection to the BB 8800. I also use this unit to take VOIP calls via Cisco IP Communicator on my Dell D620 laptop and iChat audio on my Macbook Pro. It gives you just enough freedom to roam. You start loosing your signal at about twenty feet in clear line of sight.Cons -1) Size - Unit is super tiny! It gets lost in my shirt pocket, my jacket pocket, left on the counter. Annoying when you are getting a call and your headset is still paired to your mobile. Its never a fun scramble, especially when someone important is at the other end. "Hang on a second! I need to find the headset!!!"2) Charger - Not thrilled about the charger/carrying case, but if it helps keep the size of the headset down, I can't complain too much. I feel compelled to get my wife to buy one, just so we'd have two chargers around the house - one for upstairs and another downstairs. They're cheap enough, so why not?Overall, this is the best BT headset I've ever used in the three years that I've been using them. Good show, Samsung.

reviewText: I bought the BLT-04 case to use with the Motorola H700 headset.  It fits the headset very nicely, but..  But, the design of the case does not prevent the  multifunction button from being pushed if the case is at all squeezed, even though there is a recess in the case cover you'd think would prevent that.  The result is that I'd often find the pairing light on and the battery close to drained.If you are going to clip the case on a shirt pocket, it might be ok, though even the tension of the elastic of the case is enough to push the headset button.  If the case will be put inside a briefcase or purse, then you should probably reconsider.

reviewText: Overall I have had a good experience with this device. Here are some of the pros and cons so you can get some basis for comparison when purchasing one BT headset:PROS1. Price. I got this device for $33. I don't think you can get a comparable BT headset for a lower price.2. Sound Quality. This device has good volume level and low static.  I have streched it all the way to the range limit (30 ft.) and the call quality is still good with no static.  I have left my phone or computer in the living room/middle level of my townhome and have gone up and down the stairs to other rooms without loosing the call.3. Compatibility.  I haven't had any issues pairing this device up with the following devices: Motorola PEBL, Nokia E62 and HP Pavillion laptop. I have used remote commands such as voice commands, redial or answer with the two phones with no issues, and have used it with Skype and MSN Messenger without any problem.  One user commented that the personalized/group ring tones did not transmit to the BT headset, but this is a limitation of the phone, because the MotoPEBL does not transmit a specific ring tone assigned to a person, and rather a default one, but the Nokia E62 sends the proper ring tone to the headset so you know who is calling without having to look at the phone (good when driving!)4. Battery life.  I have not tried really long calls so I can not comment on exact talk time, but overall I have used it continously in stand-by plus regular calls (for me 10-15 minutes, 4-5 calls a day) without recharging for 3-4 days.CONS:1. Bad Design.  As noted by other users, the device wiggles in your ear and you feel it is going to fall when you walk, move your head (sudden movements) or even driving (believe it or not, the inertia when making turns on you car makes this BT headset to move away from your ear, almost falling).  A strong wind will knock it out from your ear.  It fits ok, though, and does not hurt your ear (not heavy at all).  Perhaps that is the main reason why it wiggles so much, maybe it is too light.2. Powering on/off.  Since it only has one main button (two small ones for volume +/- and mute) that you use for power, pairing, answering or dial commands, then you can, for example, get into pairing mode when simply turning it on, or if attached to a phone, you may redial a call rather than turning it off.  Once you learn how to use it and pay attention to the blue led signals, it is ok, but I think it requires one extra button for power on/off.Overall I am satisfied with the purchase. If it weren't for the two CONs, I would have rated it with 5 starts.

reviewText: I spent about 4 hours doing online research on which BT headset to get my wife for her cell phone (Motorola SLVR L7c)  She wanted something cool looking and had already expressed interest in the H500, but I wanted to double check and make sure there wasn't anything better for around the same price.  So after a few hours of reading reviews on a dozen or so different headsets, I finally decided just to settle for the H500, I was really interested in some of the Plantronics sets, but she didn't care for the design.. I was a little worried about the H500 because the reviews are kinda so-so.. They're either good reviews or bad reviews.  I got it for her so she wouldn't have to fumble around in the car with a phone so how it performs in a vehicle was going to be the make or break point with it.  I'm pleased to say that the headset performs way better than I expected it to.Getting started is a breeze.  All you have to do is charge the headset for about 2 hours (the LED light will go off once the battery is charged) once it's done charging you have to pair it up with your phone.  All you do is press and hold the call button until the LED light stops blinking and stays lit, then you have your phone set to hands free mode and follow the simple steps on the phone (For us it was as simple as the phone finding the H500 and entering the 4-digit pin of 0000)  The phone saved the settings and we were all set.Using the headset is no brainer basically.  There 3 buttons; Main call/multi button & Volume up & down buttons.  Pressing these buttons in various combos will yield different results like mute, hold, transfer, 3-way, etc. The retail package comes with a handy fold out that has all the functions and how to access them.The build quality of the headset is great as well.. The headset is about 2 inches from earclip to mic.  Its very small and very comfortable to wear.  The ear clip is removable to you can use it on either ear as well.  The buttons feel solid as well.Now to the actual sound quality.  The headset has performed great in all the scenarios we've tried so far.. Which has been in the house while watching TV, In the car with the stereo & windows up & down & in an office environment.  I was most impressed with how it performed while driving, There is no static or any background noise at all and even with the radio and window down, the user can clearly be heard both ways.  Again very impressive.  The only environment we haven't really tried yet was at the store.  I will update once I've tested that as well.I can't really comment on the battery life yet, because we've only had the unit for a day or so, but so far the unit has yet needed to be charged.So to summarize, great headset overall, feels & looks great, sound quality is super, voices are loud and clear.  Performance in the car, home & office was excellent and the price Amazon offers is great compared to retail.  I'm very very satisfied (and relieved!) that this unit performs as well as it does.

reviewText: I used to have a Motorola H500 which worked well for my phone. Unfortunately I misplaced it. So I eventually bought another one via Amazon. When I got it, it worked but had a hissing and crackle sound. I thought it was my phone and the problem would eventually go away. It did not. This was suppose to be a brand new headset. It's defective and I did not return it immediately. So I'm giving this supplier a 1 star.

reviewText: Pros:  Works as it should. Easy connection to the phone.  Good talk time. Comfortable fit on the ear.  Easy to use.One Con: I could use this headset without any problems. My wife would get bad echo issues where the person she was talking with heard themselves as an echo.  Guess it has to do with the fit to the ear.  In my case the path from the earpiece to the mike was blocked but open in her case.  She had the same issue with a Motorola H500 earpiece and i can use the same Motorola earpiece fine.Purchased a Plantronics 510 which works for her.  No reports of echo from the person she is talking with.

reviewText: Although weight, sound and battery are good, I really dislike this headset's design. If you are a totally predictable person who does the same thing every day and never gets dirt on your cuffs, it's ok. If you are on the go, the wire clip will come loose in your pocket or in your computer bag. The pen holder doesn't do anything to shield the clip, in fact it adds weight that causes more force against the exposed headset. I had to recrimp the loop to make it tight enough not to come loose. The pen cap itself is required baggage for no good reason. Rather than give you a standard mini usb connector on the device, you must now haul this cap everywhere. Hey, I don't always wear a shirt with pockets. After two weeks I misplaced it on a trip and so the expensive headset is sitting on the shelf while I ponder whether to buy another useless pen clip or to cook up my own connector. There is no excuse for non-standard connectors and charging solutions, but watch this company do it over again.(several months later) I finally am tossing out this headset. The pen clip holder was eventually found and I tried to make a go with this device. I don't like to get rid of working items, but I have had the earpiece and ear hook fall off many times in my pocket and this last time, they fell elsewhere and are lost. Would you believe it couldn't even stand up to the pressure of the inside of my suit coat? I did get a box to carry it in, but that was cumbersome because of the charging holder, and now it doesn't matter because I would have to buy a new hook and earpiece. Just ordered a Motorola H500, lower cost, lots of color choices and very long talk time PLUS a standard mini USB jack. I got a travel case for less than $4. Got one for my daughter for Xmas and she proved it to be a better headset.

reviewText: I purchased an LG Env3 and I wanted to stay within the LG products category since they made me such an awesome cell phone and TV.  So I did a search for LG stereo headset after I realized my phone did mp3 music and this headset popped up first.  And it showed up first in my search because it deserves to be recognized.  I love this headset.  Even with the stock headphones that come with it I have good loud stereo phone calls and music.  And no, the audio quality with the standard headset is not spectacular, but LG knew that and made it to where you can use your favorite headphones with your cell phone for music.  I owned a Samsung stereo headset to match my SCH-U740 and it did not offer stereo phone calls.  So here are my Pros and Cons for the product as it stands having owned them for 5 months.Pros:+Provides stereo phone calls and music+Goes as loud as you'd like and then some. I couldn't hear one of my friend's on my Jabra BT8040 but I heard him loud and in stereo with this headset+Volume knob on the silver microphone piece for changing the volume on the fly+Price is awesome compared to a bluetooth stereo headset+Reduces drain on your phone battery by keeping bluetooth signal broadcast off+Call button allows you to call the last number (press once), say a voice command (hold button), or hang up the call (press once again) with my Env3+Designed to work with any set of 3.5mm headphones+Has a spring tension clip allowing you to clip it to your clothing or to your seatbelt+Worked as a hands-free calling device through the stereo and speakers in my car! (Details below)+Lightweight. Could be used for running with the right headphones. I did not test this myself though+I can run it underneath my shirt and clip it to my collar to hide the wire. The wire from the 2.5mm end to the control part looks to be about 2 feet long+No complaints about sound quality no matter where I placed it to talk. Including under my sheets and comforter when I went to bedCons (of course)-Low quality headphone included for mp3 playback-The center control is where the weight is so if it isn't clipped to you and you lean over it will pull on the headphones-Does not have wind reduction properties so windy environments may interrupt conversation-The cord from the 2.5mm end to the silver control section is quite long not including added headphone length.  Keeping it discrete outside of clothing would prove difficult-Only way to mute a call is to mute it on the phone.  Cannot mute the headset microphoneThe cons all have to do with the individual.  I love this headset more than any bluetooth I've ever bought.  And I was going to tell you a story about the hands-free headset in my car.  Well, I have one of those tape to 3.5mm headphone jack adapters that works in cars with tape players.  I was on the road and I didn't want the headphones in so I plugged the 3.5mm adapter end into the headset, inserted the tape, turned up the volume, and made a call.  It worked perfectly!  I was able to turn the volume up on the radio and listen to the call through all of my speakers.  The person on the other end told me that the sound was great until the volume in the car was up so loud that his voice was echoing back into the microphone.  But the best part was that the headset wasn't clipped to me, it was in the passengers seat and I was having a conversation without the person asking if something was different.  My next project will be seeing if my radio broadcasting adapter will broadcast my call through my stereo just as well.  I'll try to remember to update when I know for sure.  Trust me, if you're not hung up on being ahead of the technological curve with stereo bluetooth this headset will impress you without a doubt.  Definitely one of the best purchases I will ever make and I can highly recommend it!

reviewText: I've been testing 8 headsets and to my surprize, this little thing has better sound quality than 7 of them! (The one exception I'll explain) First of all it's super light and fits so well that you'll forget it's in your ear. Really! It feels so snug that it doesn't feel like it might fall out, unlike many others. (Forget that optional ear loop thing. It made it worse.) Second, when it needs recharging there's no need for plugging and unplugging wires. Just set it in it's case and close the lid. Take it out when it's done. (The case stays plugged in. No messing with the wire.) Third and most important to me is the sound quality. I compared these 8 headsets: Plantronics Voyager 510, Plantronics Explorer 320, Jabra BT8040, Jabra BT500, Motorola HS850, Motorola H700, Jawbone, Samsung WEP200. I compared them head-to-head by pairing two at a time, putting one in each ear, and switching between them while on the same call. This lets me and the caller compare the sound quality for both of us. I do this in a few different environments with a few different background sounds. This puppy sounded clearer than all the others except one and specifically in one situation. Here's the exception: loud background noise. Now hear me out, I work in construction and background noise is a huge issue for me at work. I've never found any headset that handles background noise better than the Plantronics Voyager 510. Not the Jawbone or anything else. So for me the Samsung WEP200 won't work. Mostly because of the background noise, but also because it's cute red color would make me stand out like a bullseye at a firing range. But, it's not for me! It's for my mom and she loves it! (and she won't be doing construction anytime soon) So if you don't have a noisy environment then I give this an A+. Yes, it sounds hollow in a car. Yes, if the wind blows straight into it the caller can't hear you. But I haven't found one that doesn't do that, and this has clearer sound than all of them. (With my one exception) Oh, one more thing. It has 4 hours of talk time which is less than the others (they range from 6-12), so if you talk a lot, for the price you can buy two. Charge and pair them both and you'll have a spare.

reviewText: I had the N75 about two weeks and here is my report:o I find the loose-fitting lid an irritant.  Maybe other(')s don't.o Mine doesn't make any funny internal sounds.o Mine doesn't get hot.o Mine doesn't drop calls.o No stero bluetooth.o Mine seems to do a good job of voice recognition.o It bluetooths to my Moto H500 quickly, and the voice recognition worksfine there also.o The surface does soak up finger prints.o The display screens are spectacular.o I like the large buttons on the key pad.o Large screen, large buttons = large phone, I guess.o The battery goes flat pretty fast (one day), but I'm constantlyplaying with the phone.  Maybe when the newness wears off, It'lldo better.o The pop-port is a pain; also, they should have put it on the topor bottom.o Transferring pictures, music and application using the pop-portis a breeze.  It's quicker than screwing with the microSD.o Speaker are loud enough.o Being able to load different application is neat.o The pictures seem plenty sharp for a 2 Mega-pixel. If you blow themup, they become pixelated (see submitted pictures).o I'm going to keep it and hope for a battery solution, or learn tolive with it.

reviewText: first off, you gotta be careful not to get duped by counterfeit headsets. i've learned the hard way myself and suspect this might be part of the problem people are having. another might be inadequate bluetooth in the cell phone itself. in any case this S9 works perfectly with my LG Voyager from Verizon. music sound quality is superb for small headphones. pairs easily. works flawlessly indoors. outside, the occasional static, but far less than my H700 headset.  when i talk to people on the phone they say they like how i sound on the S9 better than on my H700.  better call quality and clarity.  for calls, the left headphone becomes the ear piece and the right doubles as the mic.  you can leave it in your ear and people will hear you perfectly, even in loud locations. i'm soft spoken yet everyone hears me great on the S9.  for music, you can skip forward and back to other tracks right from the headset controls, adjust volume and answer calls.  all and all, i don't agree with the negative reviews some have given it. this is an awesome headset that works better than expected. glad i got it!!!!

reviewText: UPDATE 11/23/2010: The DRBT50's now have more (and less!) functionality when used with the iOS 4.2+ software. You can now change volume for the headphones using the onscreen volume sliders (previously the volume bar changed to say "DRBT50" and you had to control it using the headphone controls). You also have the option to output sound to either the headphones or ipad speakers (a new toggle icon appears when the headphones are on) which is nicer than having to turn them off completely to use the ipad speakers. You can also go to next/previous song using the built-in controls. You still need to press the play/pause button for them to connect, unfortunately (other bluetooth devices connect instantly when turned on).Unfortunately, this comes with a huge downside.. videos default to playing audio through the ipad speakers. If you listen to music through the headphones and a music video comes up, the sound will come out of the ipad (you need to go into the controls and change it every time one comes up!) Even worse, other sounds such as those from games also default to the iPad speakers.. but have no option to output to the headphones (which previously worked perfectly). The downsides far outweigh the positive additions in this case, and it's something that needs to be fixed.Original review:I picked up the DRBT50 headphones for my iPad, mainly for peace of mind. I like listening to music on my iPad, but find my headphone cord always ending up in the wrong spot - getting stuck in my chair or wrapped around something. I get that "If I had just rolled my chair out, the iPad would've gone crashing down" feeling. Whether it's with short cords or long ones (long cords have the problem of being too long!). I wanted a wireless option that had great sound but didn't break the bank.The DRBT50 has been the closest to that, that I've found.Pairing is rather quick  (but you will need to read the manual on how to do it). Unfortunately the iPad doesn't automatically connect to it - this means that you not only need to turn the headphones on, but connect them in the Settings -> Bluetooth option. Annoying if you walk out of range or connect/disconnect the headphones all day. (UPDATE: I found that hitting the Play/Pause button on the headphones will connect it to the iPad without having to go into the options!)Battery life is very good and a charger is included - unfortunately it's an AC Adapter unlike the mini-USB port that most use.The headphones are very stylish and fold up very nicely (a big problem with the other headphones).The controls on the side are a nice idea, but more trouble than they're worth (at least to me). They're small buttons and I always find myself hitting the wrong one. Most of them will NOT work on the iPhone/iPod/iPad (only the VOL+, VOL- and Play/Pause buttons work). No big loss since the controls are so hard to find (they're behind the ear). (UPDATE: The buttons have gotten easier to find after further use - still not the easist, but definitely do-able (especially for volume)When paired with the iPad, it "takes control" of the volume (so you need to use the iPad to change the volume). See the product image I've attached to the item page.Sound is very good - I've heard complaints that it doesn't block out noise as good as it should (while I don't use it in the loudest places, I found it to block out most noises - not "noise cancelling" though). Bass could be better, but overall not bad. Not up to par with mySennheiser HD-595 Premier Headphone, but it's also a third of the price and bluetooth.I would have liked a headphone input jack for those times you want to use it with a non-bluetooth device (like a home theater).I havent used it as a headset yet, but heard it does a decent job.Overall a very good product and possibly the best bluetooth headphones available in this price range. If you need something compact and high quality, and can deal with some of its oddities like the button placement, need for AC adapter and pairing issues, it's a great little addition!

reviewText: I have this headset, and I feel like it's a pretty good device.  I've had it for a while and still haven't used the stereo speaker setup.  The headset connects well with my Lg Vx8700 and Blackberry 8830.  The earhooks can be adjusted to fit any ear and is required for use.  They don't last very long before breakage, so I would recommend ordering more from the Jabra website ($7 for 5).  Overall, a good device.

reviewText: I purchased this Bluetooth headset as a replacement for a Motorola H700 that I had used for about 1.5 years before losing it =(Initially I was excited about the prospect of having a headset that could convert into bluetooth headphones. I used my other bluetooth all the time for work (to connect to my iPhone and my MacBook Pro) and having a stereo headset available for conference calls and product demonstrations would have been really nice. Anyhow, enough about me and my usage habits. Here's my review:3/5 stars.It's a solid product, but I experienced myriad problems trying to keep it connected to my MacBook Pro and my iPhone. Other users on Amazon have praised it's rock-solid connection, but I did not share their luck. While the pairing process itself was simple, it failed to stay connected to my MacBook for longer than 5 minutes (very annoying when you are trying to watch a product demo that is 30 minutes long and your headphones continuously cut out). I had slightly better luck with the iPhone. It would stay connected for up to 30-40 minutes (a MUST for long conference calls), but it was totally unreliable after 40 minutes (I had it drop out on two different hour long+ calls last week).Connectivity issues aside, it's a real solid performer. The call quality was excellent when connected. I was told that my voice was noticeably better (than my old Motorola bluetooth). Likewise, when I could get the headset to stay connected to my MacBook Pro, the stereo audio was more than acceptable for a bluetooth connection. It even had more base than I was expecting.Battery life is also quite good. I was using it nearly 3 hours a day between calls and computer usage and I only found myself charging it every 3-4 days.Another nice feature is the screen. I know it seems silly to have a screen on something that is attached to your head most of the time you are using it, but I really underestimated the utility. I actually stopped carrying my phone around the office and just took the headset. I could see caller ID, check bluetooth battery life, and even dial from the (small, but amazing for a bluetooth headset) internal phonebook.The one serious issue besides the connectivity that I had with it was how it sat on my ear. It takes a while to figure out how to put it on (HINT: when you put it on, swivel the ear hook towards the front end of the ear piece, put it next to your ear, and swivel the hook back over your ear like you're locking handcuffs). It's important to note that you shouldn't try to fit the little speaker unit inside your ear (even though it TOTALLY seems like it should go in). If you follow my hint above to put it on, the speaker will just sit outside your ear comfortably. If you try to fit it inside your ear, there is a little nub that will poke the inside of your ear and begin to hurt after just 1-2 minutes of use!!!All told, this is a great headset if you can get it to connect. As Mac/iPhone user, I had a helluva time. I'll still use it as a back up. I mean, c'mon, $20 for a stereo bluetooth headset? That's just a crazy good deal. But I will be getting another headset that is more reliable.As a side note, I never once in the entire 1.5 years of using it, lost connection with my Motorola H700 (for any reason other than the battery dying while it was on). In the week that I've had the Jabra BT8010, I've lost connection 23 times (that I remembered to count).I recommend this as a buy to any PC/non-iPhone user (or any Mac/iPhone user who is a glutton for punishment).One more thing. [..] shipped my order lightning quick. It only took 4 days via USPS from when I placed the order until I received it!

reviewText: This is the best headset i have ever used.  I used to own a jabra that had the bud that stuck in your ear and would hurt my ear from the direct sound coming into my ear. I have also had numerous wired headsets and my wife has the pink motorola h500 which has tons of background noise.The jawbone sounds just like if you were holding your phone to your ear.The jawbone comes with 4 different hoops that go behind your ear.  1 large and 1 regular for each ear.  and also comes with 4 various buds that go in your ear.  Don't get frustrated right off the back if it doesnt fit your right out of the box.  Everyone has a different shaped ear.  At first I was disapointed with the standard round bud because it kept falling out of my ear, but after changing the hoops and found a bud that fit in my ear the jawbone feels snug and doesnt fall out of my ear and i barely know its on my ear.The buttons arent that big of a deal, just learn where they are and its not a problem, or just use your answer button on your phone. You usually look to see who is calling anyway, dont you?The background noise reduction works very well, I had my dad tell me that I my voice sounded somewhat tinny (like tin can), but i turned the noise reduction off and he said it made a huge difference and would much rather have the voice sound a little off than have all the background noise.I read some reviews on amazon and they said it seemed plasticy and fragile.  Of course it is made of plastic and what bluetooth isnt?  I would actually rate the look and feel of the jawbone higher because it is think and doesnt feel light and cheezy like a lot of other bluetooth's.Overall I love this product and would recomend to anyone.

reviewText: I'm a grizzled veteran of the BT headset wars, and I'm always changing to find the "perfect" headset.  This is the closest I've come so far.Here's the good:===========================* By far, the best thing about it is the noise-cancelling feature. I'm on the road a lot, and the "max" setting almost eliminates road and background noise on the other end...my daughter said she hated talking to me when I was on the road before I bought this headset. This is a MAJOR plus, and the main reason I bought it to begin with. It simply works!* Volume is LOUD! In those noisy environments, this is a plus, and I usually have to turn it down to mid-range, even in noisy areas.* Unlike some, it is very comfortable to me, for long periods of time, and I wear mine for hours at a time. Lighweight and small...compared to my Motorola H700, it's heaven. I forget it's even on sometimes.* I love the quick disconnect, reconnect feature using the volume up/down buttons.  I use it with two phones (Motorola V325 for work and Blackberry 8700c for personal), and this makes it a breeze to switch from one to the other without having to fumble through the phone menus. (If you use it with a Blackberry, be sure to turn off the "Echo Control" setting in the BT menu for this headset.)* Clip for your shirt or pocket.* The price is very reasonable for a headset with these advanced features.So, what kept it from being 5-stars?=====================================* Proprietary charger (why not mini-USB, except to make more money?)* Slippery plastic ear hook, though they do include extras.* Talk time is okay, but not great. I can get maybe 4-5 hours out of it, putting it squarely in the average range based on my experiences.But these are minor, nitpicking complaints.  Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a small, lightweight, comfortable, noise-reducing headset.

reviewText: I love SonyEricsson phones and products. I no longer own an SE phone, and this is unfortunate as the HBH-980 would be awesome with any SE phone, I'm sure. Unfortunately, I cannot take full advantage of all the features of the HBH-980 with my current phone and laptop setup.+ PROS +* Decent Sound Quality (for cell phone and Windows music players [WinAmp, WMP, etc.])* Necklace style headphones.* Great for SonyEricsson Phones.* Looks cool.- CONS -* There is too much slack for the headphones, it hangs to low (for me at least). This is true no matter how the length is adjusted.* The sounds cuts out constantly when using the set with my BlackBerry (BB) phone. (At least once per song)* The address book feature does not work with my BB.* The charger is inconvenient for me as I no longer have a SonyEricsson phone.* There is no 3.5mm input jack.* The range is poor at best ( at least in an environment with only moderate interference )* In Windows, the next/prev buttons do not work for WinAMP. I'm sure there is a work around, but it is just unfortunate that this functionality is not working from the get go. I'm not too fond of other music players...* In Ubuntu, this device registers as a mono headset and the sound quality was horrid when listening to music with RhythmBox. This is another unfortunate discovery. Again, I'm sure there is a work around (different drivers, maybe) but it just sucks from the get go. The next/previous also did not work.Conclusion:I do not think this product is bad, but it is definitely not what I personally am looking for in a headset. I can't iterate enough that this headset works best with SE phones, and maybe Macs or Windows users using iTunes or some other player?This product would be almost 5 stars for sure if I still had my old phone.

reviewText: This is my 5th Motorola BT earpiece. As I am always looking for that best price vs. most features "balance" and I am rarely let down by the obsolete Motorola ilk. I chose the H680 and am not disappointed. This was purchased to replace my current BT earpiece the H710.Positives:It is small, attractive, sound quality is good, no complaints from others about being able to hear me, The charger works with my Verizon Droid, it is comfortable, it has an on/off switch (very handy for answering calls if you like to leave you headset off to save battery), The carrying case is nice and keeps it protected.Negatives:The carrying case is also a part of the charger (I really hate this and feel it is unnecessary).Tip:For those of you who have any call quality issues... you may have a bad unit. I have had two other units replaced in the past (unrelated models). They had been damaged upon receipt from the retailer. Motorola is very good about warranty replacements. Case in point my H710 was a replacement for an H700 that I couldn't get replaced satisfactorily via the originating third party retailer here on Amazon. Simply go to the Motorola support page, register your product and then give them a call.Hope this helps.

reviewText: I purchased this at the local AT&T; store as I needed a headset immediately when my two year old Motorola finally died. After purchasing two replacement Motorola H700s that worked for 3 weeks each and died, I was up for a change. A friend had recently purchased a Jawbone and told me her friends picked up her call from an airport, and they said it sounded great. That was appealing to me, so off I went.The 1st Jawbone was dead on arrival out of the box. It wouldn't light up to charge. AT&T; cheerfully replaced it a few hours later the same day. 2 weeks later, the wire earloop, about the diameter of a paperclip, snapped where it goes through the main body of the Jawbone. They ship 6 in total, which are either right or left ear only. The second failed about two weeks later. The issue seems to be that the loop material is either too brittle, or to small in diameter in the name of fashion. The shape of the Jawbone is a little awkward to carry with you when it's not being worn. In a computer case, it can't really be flat, so the pressure from the side of the bag snaps it. The same thing happened when I put it in my jacket pocket. When I put on the seat belt in the car, it gently rubbed against the coat and number two was toast. The third one snapped in half when I was putting it on.One more thing - bring a friend or a mirror when you go to look at one. It pulls my ear funny, so it sticks out, which never happened with the Motorola. I am going to try the Blue Ant next, and see how that one fairs. For now, the Jawbone looks like a future good product, once they re-engineer the ear loops so they aren't so fragile.

reviewText: I've had excellent success with Jabra Bluetooth handsfree products in the past, especially when used with Sony Ericsson mobile phones. In particular, my JX-10 and SP500 were the epitomes of compatibility, usability, and quality. So when I shopped for a new in-ear headset, the BT8040 seemed the obvious choice.My primary gripe with this unit is how its voice dialing DOES NOT WORK with the Sony Ericsson K790a, even though the Jabra site claims, "It Will Work :) ". The earpiece never receives the audio prompt from the phone, so the phone waits forever for a voice command it can never receive. I tried my phone with other headsets (OEM wired one, Aliph Jawbone, Moto H700) which all worked fully and flawlessly, so the phone is not at fault. I went through severl procedures with Jabra, who ultimately replaced the headset, all without success. Also, my older phones (an S710a and T637) woked perfectly well. So there's clearly a compatibility issue, once which Jabra refuses to acknowledge.Second, the BT8040 is a step backwards in usability from the JX-10. On the JX-10, all "headset" functions (initiate call via voice dialing, answer call, end call) required a single short button press, and "handsfree" functions (reject incoming call, redial last call, call waiting switch, etc.) needed only a single long button press. That couldn't be easier. The BT8040 changes some of this for the worse, such as in requiring a double-press for voice dialing while still requiring single short- and long-presses for other functions. Jabra found perfection in its controls and usability, and lost it.Finally, the BT8040's "eargel version 2" does not adequately keep the headset from rorating around in, or falling out of, your ear. The separately sold Jabra Eargels v.1 (which I used with my JX-10) are more stable and more comfortable. Sadly, these v.1 eargels do not fit this headset.With the BT8040, Jabra's maintained their other attributes - functionality, call quality and volume, build quality, small size and light weight - hence I give it 2 stars instead of one. But the incompatibility is unacceptable, especially with Sony Ericsson phones (the kings of Bluetooth). The lacking usability and stability further diminish the BT8040's desirability.

reviewText: I've had excellent success with Jabra Bluetooth handsfree products in the past, especially when used with Sony Ericsson mobile phones. In particular, my JX-10 and SP500 were the epitomes of compatibility, usability, and quality. So when I shopped for a new in-ear headset, the BT8040 seemed the obvious choice.My primary gripe with this unit is how its voice dialing DOES NOT WORK with the Sony Ericsson K790a, even though the Jabra site claims, "It Will Work :) ". The earpiece never receives the audio prompt from the phone, so the phone waits forever for a voice command it can never receive. I tried my phone with other headsets (OEM wired one, Aliph Jawbone, Moto H700) which all worked fully and flawlessly, so the phone is not at fault. I went through severl procedures with Jabra, who ultimately replaced the headset, all without success. Also, my older phones (an S710a and T637) woked perfectly well. So there's clearly a compatibility issue, once which Jabra refuses to acknowledge.Second, the BT8040 is a step backwards in usability from the JX-10. On the JX-10, all "headset" functions (initiate call via voice dialing, answer call, end call) required a single short button press, and "handsfree" functions (reject incoming call, redial last call, call waiting switch, etc.) needed only a single long button press. That couldn't be easier. The BT8040 changes some of this for the worse, such as in requiring a double-press for voice dialing while still requiring single short- and long-presses for other functions. Jabra found perfection in its controls and usability, and lost it.Finally, the BT8040's "eargel version 2" does not adequately keep the headset from rorating around in, or falling out of, your ear.

reviewText: I have had many Bluetooth headsets and all of them had some sort of quirk or other. I have paid much more for some of the others than I paid for the Jabra BT-8040 but so far my Jabra is the best. I like the small size though I had smaller. It fits in my ear nicely and doesn't keep falling out of my ear like my last bluetooth, a Plantronics Discovery 925. I would like the volume to be a little louder. Also on occasion it acts strange when I try to do voice commands. I have to attempt 2 or 3 times to get it in voice command mode. Other than that it's a great little headset.

reviewText: I tested a BT8040 head-to-head with a Plantronics 510 (I've owned one for years) and a Motorola H710.The 510 has the best audio quality, both for the wearer and the caller.  It is actually usable in a car at highway speeds with the radio on moderately loud and all windows down.  Callers do hear the background noise, of course.  The fit is comfortable for several hours.  This would be my choice for office or car.  But, its annoying flashing blue light, it's bulky size, the relative difficulty of placing it on the ear and its general lack of pocketability due to its shape make it a marginal all-around headset.  The headset simultaneously pairs and works great with both my phones: the Uniden cordless land-line phone at the office and my Palm Centro smartphone.The H710 has very loud audio for the wearer.  I couldn't use it at full loud except for the highway test.  It is very pocketable and reasonably unobtrusive.  It "flaps" against my ear when I move my head, though it's never fallen off.  And, audio quality to callers in noisy environments is significantly below that of the other two headsets.  In the highway test, I was unintelligible to callers.  The H710 pairs with both phones, but echo cancellation doesn't work when connected with the Uniden -- I hear my own voice with a a delay.The BT8040 is my favorite all-around headset.  It fits my ear very well and is comfortable for hours at a time. It is *very* small and unobtrusive; no flashing lights asking for the attention of passers-by.  The sound quality in quiet and noisy environments is nearly the equal of the 510, however, audio for the wearer cut in and out on the highway test as if the echo cancellation algorithms were being confused.  The BT8040 fails to pair with the Uniden cordless land-line phone I use in my office.  The BT8040 fails to pair with the Uniden, and this should be a show-stopper.  But its feature set is otherwise so good than I'm looking for a new BT capable land line phone for the office.

reviewText: I tested this unit against 8 other headsets and it had the worst sound quality, by far. I still can't beleive it! Considering the special features designed for sound quality I was expecting the best sound ever, but oh well. The way I compared headsets was to pair two at a time, put one in each ear, and then switch between them while on the same call. This allowed me and the caller to compare sound quality equally while in a variety of environments, and from both ends of the call. I tested these headsets: Jabra BT8040, Jabra BT500, Plantronics Voyager 510, Plantronics Explorer 320, Motorola HS850, Motorola H700, Jawbone, Samsung WEP200. The problem was that the sound quality for the caller was so bad that they could hardly understand a word I said. If I held the unit a few inches in front of my mouth they could hear me clearly but not when it was in my ear. With all the other units I tested I go through a series of background noise tests with both the caller and myself talking and listening, but in this case we weren't able to comunicate well enough to get that done. After testing the other units we went back and tried this one some more but nothing seemed to make a difference. This is a beautifull headset. It looks great, feels great, with great function and fit, but if they can't understand what I'm saying then there's no point. Man, I'm bummed! And I really liked this one, too!

reviewText: I won't try to top the  Doc. from Washington's review. Same experience here. This is the fifth bluetooth device I've purchased and blows all the others away. My purchase of the H710 was on the strength of a friend's use of an H700. He was the only caller with a bluetooth ear device from whom I could hear every word clearly. This H710 is absolutely the best on everything from utility to comfort. Don't even consider any other. A rare home run from Motorola. Quite a contrast from my wife's crap Motor-oh-no V3m Razr phone. (In comparison to my Samsung U900, another winner).One thing I neglected to mention. Since this device doesn't violate your ear orifice, it may be used successfully with hearing aids.

Was very easy to set up with my t-mobile dash.  lasts forever, good sound - lack of ear plug a big plus.when washed this one by accident replaced with h721 cause only version i could find local, would have replaced with h710 if i could have found it.uses micro usb charger and not mini like the dash but you can get adaptor so u can  charge with same charger.

reviewText: I received my Motorola H710 today.  I was able to pair it, charge it and use it without using the instructions, it is that easy to use.  From what I can see, the sound is superb.  It connects immediately when you open the boom.  I had a Motorola H500 previously and had nothing but problems.  I highly recommend this model.  From the reviews I have read it offers superior wind noise reduction also.  Can't wait for summer to open my sunroof and give it a try!!

reviewText: Overall, I've been extremely satisfied with Motorola's H7XX series.  I actually purchased the H710 and about the time the warranty was to expired I used it.  On Motorola's mistake, they sent me a H715 instead.  I didn't immediately notice though but little things were different.  The black shade was a little different and then I noticed "tones". Tones when I would connect, disconnect, etc. that I did not have with the H710.  I like both colors and they both go good with my original iPhone.  I think amazon has the best price on both of these... I would highly recommend them.  I am currently testing the Plantronics Voyager Pro and notice that it doesn't like my blackberry.  It works fine with my original iPhone but the voice quality isn't as great as it was with the H7XX series.  I'm returning it and requesting a replacement to see if it was just that one headset.  I'm really rooting for the PRO.  I find the H7XX series are easier to carry in the pocket as it folds nicely.  The PRO feels great and the smallest ear rubber piece works great for my ears.  I've had the headset on for hours and using the smallest ear rubber has worked the best. But enough of the Pro.  Thank you for your time.UPDATE 01/09/2012These Motorola H7XX series seem to have about a 10-16 month lifespan.  And still I love them.  I have used the Motorola warranty right before the 1 year limit and have received either a refurbished or a brand new one which again last about another year or so.  So with that I will drop my overall rating to a 4 STAR.

reviewText: After losing my last Plantronics 510 to a "dog incident", I picked up another 510, a Motorola H710 and a Jabra BT8040 and put them to the test head-to-head.  I use a Uniden cordless land-line phone that can pair with a BT headset, and a Palm Centro smartphone.  All three of these phones support multipoint.  The H710 failed to cancel echo (my voice played back to me delayed) on the Uniden phone, and the BT8040 would not pair with the Uniden at all.  All three worked well with the Centro.All three headsets had very good audio quality in quiet environments.  The 510 was best in noisy and windy environments.  The H710 had the loudest volume and was easiest to hear callers.  The BT8040 in extremely loud environments would apparently get confused in its echo cancellation algorithms and tend to experience audio cutouts (for the wearer, not the caller).The H710 has the best "user interface".  Love how flipping the little boom mike open and closed turns on and off the headset.  It's audio prompts are intuitive and pleasant.  The BT8040 and H710 both have good button/LED usage designs.  The BT8040 requires a 3-5 second button press to turn the phone on and off -- otherwise it is the user interface equal to the H710.  In comparison, the 510 has a less polished interface.  The power button is hard to use, and it constantly flashes a blue light when on, which grabs the attention of those around you -- a feature that I find quite annoying. The interface of the BT8040 is just as good, with the exception that on and off requires a 3-5 second button press -- less elegant than the H710's approach.  The 510 has a big flaw in its user interface: a blue light flashes all the time it is on.  Combined with its large size, the 510 annoyingly draws the attention of those around you.Pocketability is a big concern for me.  The 510 isn't really pocketable.  I never broke one in 3 years, but then almost never put it in my pocket for fear of breaking it.  The H710 when off is nearly a sphere and is easily pocketable.  The BT8040 is a micro-sized "brick" in shape, smaller than the H710 and about equally pocketable.Headset fit is another bit concern.  The 510 is the most comfortable for me.  The BT8040 is second, which surprised me.  The H710's hard ear-loop rubs on my ear in one spot and pretty quickly becomes uncomfortable.  The 510 isn't amenable to glasses, but the other two are.  All of the headsets are secure.  The 510 fits well as a result of its design.  The BT8040 fits well, in part because it is so very small and light.  The H710 'hangs' and 'flaps' against the ear, is the least secure of all three, but didn't ever fall off when I was testing it.Battery life is good on all units.  I don't talk enough to give them a hard workout in this regard.  However, the 510 seems to take the longest to charge, the BT8040 the fastest, and the H710 in the middle.I found the H710 to be the worst of the three.  It's performance in noisy conditions doesn't compare well to the others.  It's fit is the worst, at least on my ear.  The H710 is definitely the loudest of the three, which could be a boon for many headset wearers.  Just don't plan on using it in very noisy situations.

All three worked well with the Centro.All three headsets had very good audio quality in quiet environments.  The 510 was best in noisy and windy environments.  The H710 had the loudest volume and was easiest to hear callers.  The BT8040 in extremely loud environments would apparently get confused in its echo cancellation algorithms and tend to experience audio cutouts (for the wearer, not the caller).The H710 has the best "user interface".  Love how flipping the little boom mike open and closed turns on and off the headset.  It's audio prompts are intuitive and pleasant.  The BT8040 and H710 both have good button/LED usage designs.  The BT8040 requires a 3-5 second button press to turn the phone on and off -- otherwise it is the user interface equal to the H710.  In comparison, the 510 has a less polished interface.  The power button is hard to use, and it constantly flashes a blue light when on, which grabs the attention of those around you -- a feature that I find quite annoying. The interface of the BT8040 is just as good, with the exception that on and off requires a 3-5 second button press -- less elegant than the H710's approach.  The 510 has a big flaw in its user interface: a blue light flashes all the time it is on.  Combined with its large size, the 510 annoyingly draws the attention of those around you.Pocketability is a big concern for me.  The 510 isn't really pocketable.  I never broke one in 3 years, but then almost never put it in my pocket for fear of breaking it.  The H710 when off is nearly a sphere and is easily pocketable.  The BT8040 is a micro-sized "brick" in shape, smaller than the H710 and about equally pocketable.Headset fit is another bit concern.  The 510 is the most comfortable for me.  The BT8040 is second, which surprised me.  The H710's hard ear-loop rubs on my ear in one spot and pretty quickly becomes uncomfortable.  The 510 isn't amenable to glasses, but the other two are.  All of the headsets are secure.  The 510 fits well as a result of its design.  The BT8040 fits well, in part because it is so very small and light.  The H710 'hangs' and 'flaps' against the ear, is the least secure of all three, but didn't ever fall off when I was testing it.Battery life is good on all units.  I don't talk enough to give them a hard workout in this regard.  However, the 510 seems to take the longest to charge, the BT8040 the fastest, and the H710 in the middle.I found the H710 to be the worst of the three.  It's performance in noisy conditions doesn't compare well to the others.  It's fit is the worst, at least on my ear.  The H710 is definitely the loudest of the three, which could be a boon for many headset wearers.  Just don't plan on using it in very noisy situations.

reviewText: I recently have tried a variety of headsets, including thePlantronics 510theJawbone, and theMotorola H700and H710, all to replace my trusty, old, cheap and very durable (so durable I gave up waiting for it to break, so that I could find something with better sound quality)Motorola H300.Among all these, I decided to keep the Motorola H710. It is _nearly_ perfect in all aspects, the only minor drawback compared to its predecessor, the H700, is that it has a micro-USB charging connector rather than a mini-USB one (I have tons of mini-USB peripherals, including my cell phone, camera, etc...)The Jawbone CAN be a good and comfortable fit, if the anatomy of your ear agrees with it. I was lucky that way, it was actually the most comfortable headset I have used. Even for me, though, it was not "instant love", it took a bit of training to learn how to put it on correctly in a hurry (i.e. when receiving an incoming call). The ear loops (4 different ones included in the package) are very stiff, and I can see how they would easily break after a while. The sound quality was excellent while in my car driving - even across a noisy concrete bridge there would be no way for the other party to tell. Also, incoming sound quality was great - the volume adjusts based on background noise, and the ear plugs are rubberized and block most other noise. It is also a good-looking headset; it matched my phone (a black Nokia N95 8GB) quite well. My main two issues with it were the charging connector (a proprietary one, and only a USB charging cable was included; also not that easy to plug/unplug), and the fact that the power-on time (from off to connected) was a bit too long (timing it, I got anywhere from 9 to 13 seconds..). I prefer to keep my headset turned off when not in use (battery life, connection-time issues.. etc.)The Plantronics was also great with respect to sound quality; I would say though that it did not quite beat the Jawbone while driving in a car.. (I did not try either one while walking outside in wind though). I did not quite like the large size though (my pockets are full enough already with my cell phone, keys, wallet...), and as someone mentioned, it would seem that it could easily wear out after prolonged pocket-use... Finally, I did not like the proprietary charging connector. (Give me standard mini-USB please; or else micro-USB will work too).The Motorola H700 and H710 were for me the answer to nearly every grievance I have with bluetooth headsets. You unfold the microphone boom to power it on (and automatically answer any incoming call); fold it back to power off. Simple, elegant. No confusion about whether or not the headset is already powered on or off when an incoming call arrives (I.e. no "Do I need to hold the power button down for a while to power it on, or a simple tap to just answer?" quandries). The power-on-and-connect is also one of the fastest I have seen on any headset (about the same as my old H300, and way faster than either the Jawbone or the 510). Sound quality is exceptional in either - though maybe more so with the H710 (better noise reduction, and, like the Jawbone, it adjusts your ear volume automatically to accommodate for background noise). Since you would normally keep these turned off, as opposed to leaving them on standby, a single charge will normally last you for weeks and weeks (depending on usage of course). Another plus is that they use industry standard charging connectors (mini-USB and micro-USB, respectively), so you can easily share wall/car/computer chargers with other peripherals. Finally, they are an easy fit - no one should have issues getting them on in a hurry (though for me, I actually preferred the "firm" fit of the Jawbone...).My only issue with the H700 (and this has been fixed in the H710) is an extremely short range; if I left my phone in my pocked while talking on the headset, I would hear some subtle crackling; take the phone out and hold it in my hand and it was OK. While OK for "car use", I ended up returning it and getting the H710 mainly for this reason.Good Luck in your own quest for perfection. (Nerdvana?)

No confusion about whether or not the headset is already powered on or off when an incoming call arrives (I.e. no "Do I need to hold the power button down for a while to power it on, or a simple tap to just answer?" quandries). The power-on-and-connect is also one of the fastest I have seen on any headset (about the same as my old H300, and way faster than either the Jawbone or the 510). Sound quality is exceptional in either - though maybe more so with the H710 (better noise reduction, and, like the Jawbone, it adjusts your ear volume automatically to accommodate for background noise). Since you would normally keep these turned off, as opposed to leaving them on standby, a single charge will normally last you for weeks and weeks (depending on usage of course). Another plus is that they use industry standard charging connectors (mini-USB and micro-USB, respectively), so you can easily share wall/car/computer chargers with other peripherals. Finally, they are an easy fit - no one should have issues getting them on in a hurry (though for me, I actually preferred the "firm" fit of the Jawbone...).My only issue with the H700 (and this has been fixed in the H710) is an extremely short range; if I left my phone in my pocked while talking on the headset, I would hear some subtle crackling; take the phone out and hold it in my hand and it was OK. While OK for "car use", I ended up returning it and getting the H710 mainly for this reason.Good Luck in your own quest for perfection. (Nerdvana?)

reviewText: I recently have tried a variety of headsets, including thePlantronics 510theJawbone, and theMotorola H700and H710, all to replace my trusty, old, cheap and very durable (so durable I gave up waiting for it to break, so that I could find something with better sound quality)Motorola H300.Among all these, I decided to keep the Motorola H710. It is _nearly_ perfect in all aspects, the only minor drawback compared to its predecessor, the H700, is that it has a micro-USB charging connector rather than a mini-USB one (I have tons of mini-USB peripherals, including my cell phone, camera, etc...)The Jawbone CAN be a good and comfortable fit, if the anatomy of your ear agrees with it. I was lucky that way, it was actually the most comfortable headset I have used. Even for me, though, it was not "instant love", it took a bit of training to learn how to put it on correctly in a hurry (i.e. when receiving an incoming call). The ear loops (4 different ones included in the package) are very stiff, and I can see how they would easily break after a while. The sound quality was excellent while in my car driving - even across a noisy concrete bridge there would be no way for the other party to tell. Also, incoming sound quality was great - the volume adjusts based on background noise, and the ear plugs are rubberized and block most other noise. It is also a good-looking headset; it matched my phone (a black Nokia N95 8GB) quite well. My main two issues with it were the charging connector (a proprietary one, and only a USB charging cable was included; also not that easy to plug/unplug), and the fact that the power-on time (from off to connected) was a bit too long (timing it, I got anywhere from 9 to 13 seconds..). I prefer to keep my headset turned off when not in use (battery life, connection-time issues.. etc.)The Plantronics was also great with respect to sound quality; I would say though that it did not quite beat the Jawbone while driving in a car.. (I did not try either one while walking outside in wind though). I did not quite like the large size though (my pockets are full enough already with my cell phone, keys, wallet...), and as someone mentioned, it would seem that it could easily wear out after prolonged pocket-use... Finally, I did not like the proprietary charging connector.

reviewText: I've tried jabra & plantronics previously - both went back immediately.  Was happy with both my H850 and H700 until my GF broke both of them so went with the H710 as replacements.  Very pleased.  Improvement in sound quality over the H700 is minimal (I always thought the H700 sounded fine) but there are some serious improvements in functionality.  The volume is finally loud enough on this headset compared to my previous Motos.  The battery check feature is great (flip open, hold both volume keys and see what color the LED is).  Reception is excellent with both her Razr V3 and my BB 8310.  The flip to turn on, off feature is probably my biggest like for the Moto series and only one button to answer, etc. is a no-brainer ergonomic triumph.  It's lightweight, goes in pocket easily with no worries about accidentally turning on, etc.  Oh, and the tones to let you know you've established connection with your phone or diconnected are very nice additions by Motorola on this one.  This is my third H series headset and I really wish I would just quit trying any other brand - they've always been outstanding performers for me.

reviewText: Before getting this phone I had a Sony W600 that I loved, it lasted me three years and I was reluctant to change it until my wife got me the Nokia N95.This was indeed a great choice and the best phone I've ever had!In the box besides the usual items (headphones, CD with software, etc) this one includes a car charger and a Bluetooth auricular, so you don't have to pay extra for those!The screen size is perfect and great when you navigate on the web, you can rotate the screen to what's best for you. Wi-fi is great and very fast (I can now buy from Amazon or get movie tickets from my cell phone!), you can install applications to it (like MSN) The sound from the speakers is also a great thing to notice, while speakers seem small the sound this phone has will blow you away! The software is user friendly, very easy to get used to it and its features.Another important thing to note is the camera resolution, the videos I've taken with this look great on my 50" HDTV, the resolution is simply astonishing, I like taking pictures and I used to carry my cyber-shot with me all the time but that's changed since I got this phone.I have owned several phones and most of them were Nokias, they never disappoint.Great choice of a phone, I would definitely recommend this.

reviewText: I got these because they were cheap and because I have an Insignia NS-8V24 PMP and figured they would work well with it.  Note that there are two versions, one with the USB Bluetooth adapter and one without.  The one without is widely available, the other, not so much (and costs more).  You only need the adapter if your PC or laptop does not already have a bluetooth device built in.  My Insignia player has bluetooth built in.Setup: Super.  Worked well right away.  I just followed the instructions (hold the on/off button for 7 seconds, turn on player and use search, select, done).  Once paired, they worked great.  The headset buttons can be used for play/pause, next/previous, ffwd/rew, and volume +/- and everything worked well.  The buttons take a little practice to find by feel, but have raised markings and after awhile I got the hang of it.  They do require quite a firm press, so you won't accidentally active one while adjusting your headset or anything.Sound quality:  In my opinion, excellent for a bluetooth set. Certainly as good as your average wired set.  There was nice presence and stereo image, no noise, crisp percussion, decent bass (not boomy, thank god), in short, very pleasant.  I am very happy with the sound quality.  They have plenty of volume, nice S/N ratio, good overall sound.  I compared them to a wired set I like (panasonic) and they were very comparable.  This set has a more open sound to me which I actually like. (While they may not be as good as your best set of cans, they are perfectly fine. And no damn wires!)Bluetooth functionality:  I have not yet tried the combo phone/music setup, just using with my player for now.  The connection is solid and the range is great. I tested up to 40' away or more with no problems which exceeds the 33' stated.  I left my player downstairs on the charger and walked upstairs into a bedroom.  There was a drop out when I passed behind a wall and fireplace (metal liner probably) but that was it, I had full sound all the way upstairs and in the bedroom, no problems at all.  This is far better than I expected from a bluetooth set.They support bluetooth 2.0 and 1.2 and A2DP, AVRCP, and HSP -in short everything you could want,e.g. full stereo hi-fi sound, device control, hands free operation (i.e. voice dial if your phone supports it).  Pretty good feature set that touches all the main bases.Nits:  This is my first 'behind the head' style set and it took me a bit to get used to them.  But after awhile I think I've adjusted.  The "frame" is sort of cheap, plastic looking, but seems OK (pretty much like most sets of this style I've seen).  I pulled and twisted a little and nothing came apart. ;)Reasonably comfortable, but could be a little better.  I still find the small, lightweight over the head phones the most comfortable. That said, a 3 hour session was no problem though I did need a bit of a rest after that. (The over the ear part is the issue for me, it causes some discomfort after awhile.)Overall, I would certainly recommend these as a great BT set for the money if you can still find them. I was pleasantly surprised.Update 9/18/08:  The model listed here comes without the USB key.  I got the model NS-DTHDST which comes with the USB Bluetooth key which adds Bluetooth capability to your laptop or PC (it comes with the drivers and software on CD).  I installed the sw on my laptop and it went well. Paired easily.  Now I can play MP3's on my laptop and listen w/o wires, also DVD's, -all audio goes to the headsets when connected automatically (well, within my limited tests so far, anyway).  Sounds great.This headset also has a built-in mic so you can use it with cell phones -or the laptop.  I assume you could use this as a gaming headset, but I haven't tried it.If they were over the head instead of behind, they'd be perfect.  I'm getting used to 'em, but I still prefer the over the head style.

reviewText: The itorch is a great deal with the current promotion.  For about $35 with free promotional items, i get a 3,000+ mAh portable battery charger with a flashlight and a laser pointer is awesome!I got my hands on this yesterday and was able to use it twice to test it out on my galaxy tab 7.7. .. The itorch feels really nice to hold.  The itorch is the upgrade from a powergen 3200mAh.  The powergen has a built in flashlight and a microusb cable, which i really like, but i can only charge my galaxy tab for 40% over 4 hours.  The itorch can charge my galaxy tab directly too.  My main concern is that the itorch can get pretty warm while charging.  I am a bit concern about this.The fully charged itorch is able to charge my galaxy tab for 60%, from 20-80% in three hours with the extra 6" long cable for the galaxy tab.  The p6800 galaxy tab has a battery size of 5,100mAh.  That means the itorch can putout 60% of its capacity with the extra 6" cable.  I'll test it again without the 6" cable next time and hope to see an increase in output on an iPad 3.  I'll give it a 5 stars if it has an output efficiency of 65%+.

reviewText: I just picked up one of these so the next time I go to a convention and use my !@#$% smart phone all day I won't find myself getting a low battery alert. Right now I've got my Bold plugged in to this toy, running a frakking movie and running Bluetooth and the thing is still charging the battery! The dingus comes with a plethora of adapters for different devices. As long as what you have can take power from a USB port (that's +5 VDC to the uninitiated), this baby can power it. Worth $40!BTW, I have now tried this on my Blackberry Playbook tablet and it WILL charge it!

reviewText: Beware that this is lengthy!  I figure that if you consider spending several hundred dollars on a phone, the more information the better. :)The first thing to get straight about this phone is that it is not about form, but function.  It is not the slimmest or sexiest phone out there, nor does it have the most awe-inspiring user interface compared to the likes of the iPhone.  On the other hand, it has every capability that you will find on any phone these days:* A 5MP camera with autofocus, LED flash, and VGA video recording, Carl Zeiss lens, and a 1/2.5" CCD (same as in most compact digital cameras).  Various shooting modes (macro, night, night portrait, sports, etc...), ISO control, flash control w/red-eye reduction.  Immediately send pictures via bluetooth, email, MMS, etc.* GPS with Nokia Maps application and optional voice navigation.  Various third party applications (e.g. Google Maps for S60) support its built-in GPS as well.* 3.5G (HSDPA) connectivity (see note about models below), This gives clearer voice and much faster data downloads (theoretically up to 3.5 Mbps; in practice I have seen from 900 Kbps to about 2.2 Mbps, depending on location and time of day).* WiFi (802.11g) with WEP, WPA/WPA2, and EAP/802.1x authentication (for corporate environments)* Support for nearly every Bluetooh profile in existence: A2DP for stereo audio, DUN for tethering the phone's internet connection with a laptop (for on-the road use), OBEX to send/receive files and browse the internal filesystem from a computer.* 3.5mm headset jack, infrared port w/send/receive utility, FM tuner.* "Dual slider" design: Slide display up to reveal numeric keypad; and down to reveal four multimedia buttons (Play/Pause, stop, rewind, fast forward).  Sliding it down also changes the display orientation from portrait to landscape; sliding it up switches it back.* Symbian S60 smartphone OS: In addition to thousands of available generic Java (J2ME) mobile applications, there are also nearly an equal number of native applications that can access additional functionality/hardware on the phone (for instance, there is one that uses the built-in accelerometer to control your computer's mouse cursor by simply tilting the phone, and another one that uses the built-in GPS to "geotag" pictures with your location as you use the camera).* Built-in applictions include QuickOffice to read Microsoft Office files (DOC, PPT, XLS), Adobe Acrobat Lite reader (PDF), RealPlayer (most media files/streams), home screen "Search" applet to search the Internet and local content, various organizer apps (clock w/unlimited alarms, phonebook with unlimited entries, calendar w/unlimited meetings, todos, memos, reminders..), calculator, unit converter -- you get the picture.  Notably absent, though, is a Timer/Stopwatch application; however you can easily download a third party one (e.g. from Smartphoneware).* Other S60-specific applications include Nokia's Internet Radio to stream live radio streams, "RotateMe" to automatically rotate the screen depending on your phone orientation, "Fring" mobile Skype/AIM/MSN/Google Talk/etc.. client, Google Maps with GPS support, Google home screen search applet, Mobile Weather app, "ExtGPS" to share the internal GPS information over bluetooth (e.g. to theNokia N800 Internet Tablet), YouTube player, emTube (also for YouTube access), etc.* One of the best mobile web browsers out there.  Based on AppleWebKit (a.k.a. KTML, the web engine used in the likes of Apple Safari and KDE Konqueror), it renders web pages "as they were meant to be".  And unlike that other phone that claims to do the same, the N95 also has a built-in Flash Lite player - so web pages that use flash will work as well.  Plus, you are of course free to download and use other browsers, such as the excellent, super-fast and bandwidth-saving Opera Mini (operamini.com).* Mail client with POP-3 and IMAP support (including IMAP-IDLE, a.k.a. "push mail"; alternatively it can poll at specified intervals).* Mac OS X users: Although the phone does not come with bundled software for Mac OS X, you can download "Nokia Multimedia Transfer" (to synchronize photos and music with iPhoto and iTunes) and an iSync plugin (to synchronize the address book, calendar, todo etc) with your Mac - both from Nokia's web site.  Also, setting up your Mac to access the Internet via the phone (providing that you have a data plan, e.g. the $15/month "MEdia Net Unlimited" from AT&T;) is super-easy: When you first pair with the phone, the needed WAP/APN information is pulled automatically from your Phone's SIM card.  (Ironically, this works for nearly every phone, except Apple's own iPhone; this one has a very crippled bluetooth stack, and does also not support tethering).  UPDATE: I've learned that such tethering violates AT&T;'s Terms of Service.  Moreover, there are no  plans available for this phone (or most others) from AT&T; that specifically allow tethering.  If you do so anyway, stay under the radar, and don't abuse it - e.g. by using your cellular data plan as your main internet service.MODELS:=======There are 5 subflavors of the N95 released to date:* The original N95 (a.k.a. N95-1, a.k.a. RM-159) targeted mainly the European and Asian markets; while it had quad-band GSM (2G) support for use in nearly every country, including the USA, it had support only for the international W-CDMA (UMTS/HSDPA, a.k.a. 3G/3.5G) frequency (commonly referred to as UMTS-2100).  Nonetheless, this phone was later made available for retail in the USA as well, through Nokia's flagship stores, online site, and 3rd party retailers.  It had manual shutter lens protection (you would slide it open to start the camera), 64MB of runtime/dynamic memory (RAM), and a 900 mAh battery.  Common complaints about this phone was that it would often run out of memory when several applications were open, and that the battery life was too short.* The N95-2 (a.k.a. "N95 8GB", a.k.a. RM-320) increased the screen size from 2.6" to 2.8" (diagonal), increased RAM from 64MB to 128MB, increased the battery size from 900 mAh to 1200 mAh, removed the slider mechanism for opening the camera lens, replaced the SDHC card slot with 8GB of internal flash, and replaced the silver faceplate with an all-black design.  However, the bands supported were the same: W-CDMA 2100MHz, GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz - so although it will work fine with both AT&T; Wireless, T-Mobile USA and Rogers, it does not support 3G/3.5G network speeds in North America.  Nonetheless, as with the N95-1, Nokia has sold this phone in North America as well until just a few weeks ago; so possibly, this is the phone sold here (Unfortunately, Nokia's own sales channels do not normally make this distinction, and Amazon's product description is also somewhat lacking).  UPDATE: As the product description now clearly says, this is the N95-4 (a.k.a. N95 8GB NAM) model.* The N95-3 (a.k.a. "N95 NAM", RM-160) is the first model targeted for North America.  Most of the exterior design is similar to the N95-1 (Silver faceplate, 2.6" screen, SDHC slot), but like the N95-2, it has 128MB of RAM, a 1200 mAh battery, and no manual slider for the camera shutter.  The main reason for its existence is that it swapped the original UMTS-2100 (WCDMA) frequency for UMTS-850 and UMTS-1900, so that it would work with AT&T; Wireless's 3G/3.5G network.  Until just a few days/weeks ago, this would have been the "best" choice for US customers.* The N95-4 (a.k.a. "N95 8GB NAM", RM-421) is identical to the N95-2, except that like the N95-3, it swaps UMTS-2100 for UMTS-850/1900.  It was released just a couple of weeks ago, though, so if Amazon got their inventory of "n95 8gb" devices from Nokia prior to this, it would have been the N95-2 rather than the N95-4.  (The exterior and labeling of both is the same).  Also, the firmware revision numbers are different, so some utilities (like the "Nokia Multimedia Transfer" application and iSync plugin for Mac OS X) do not yet recognize this phone. UPDATE: The N95-4 is now fully supported by most applications, including Nokia Multimeda Transfer and iSync plugin.* The N95-5 is for Japan; it is a stripped-down version of the N95-1 (e.g. no WiFi). UPDATE: As someone commented below, it is actually for China.COMPARED WITH OTHER PHONES:==========================N95 vs. iPhone==============This is almost an irrational comparison, given how different these devices are:* The iPhone is almost entirely about "sex appeal": Polished, slim, with a large screen for viewing content, multi-touch user interface (we've all seen how to zoom in and out using finger pinches, do inertial scrolling through a list of contacts, etc).  As such, it is very big on "usability".  The N95 is not even a touch-screen device.  (Personally I actually prefer "hard" keys w/tactile feedback; having used the touch-screen based Motorola A1200 MING in the past.  Touch screens are not very good for, for example, dialing a number without looking at the screen).* The iPhone feature set is, at best, mediocre.  Yes, it has WiFi - so does a lot of other phones.  Yes, it has a "WYSIWYG" web browser; again, so do so many others (including the 3-year oldMotorola A1200 MING, another touch-screen phone by the way).  However, it lacks: 3G support, GPS, Infrared, FM Radio, decent camera functionality (no flash, video recording, etc), 3rd party application support (e.g. no Internet Radio, GPS navigation, etc), or even a usable Bluetooth stack (to do silly little things like transfer files or enable internet access for a nearby laptop while on the road).  Even the otherwise crappy Motorola RAZR line (e.g. RAZR v3xx) do most of these things. UPDATE: With the release of the iPhone 3G and the new App Store, Apple has come a long way.  It's worth pointing out though that the iPhone can still not run standard J2ME/MIDP mobile applications, only those released specifically for the iPhone through the App store.  Per the Apple Terms of Service, this means: No 3rd party web browser (e.g. Opera Mini), no voice navigation, not even something along the lines of Nokia Sports Tracker (since it uses the GPS).* The iPhone is only available with a 2-year contract from AT&T; the N95 is only available SIM-free (unlocked).In short: The iPhone is about form, the N95 (and Symbian devices in general) about function.N95 vs.Sony Ericsson K850i===========================These are the only two 5MP camera phones available for the US market.  Neither of them is offered by a carrier (AT&T;, T-Mobile, Cellular One, Rogers...), so in both cases you will pay the full price for the phone.  (The upside, of course, is that you will not need to renew your contract to get it.. :)Also, both phones (in the case of the N95, some flavors of it) support the U.S. 3G bands, in addition to being quad-band GSM phones.  The difference here is that the k850i supports all four GSM bands and all three UMTS bands at the same time, so you don't have to pick a "US" vs. "International" flavor.  Finally, both phones have built-in FM tuners - though the k850i also supports RDM to display programming information transmitted in the broadcast.Most comparisons of these phones therefore center around the camera functionality (e.g. PhoneArena.com, GSMArena.com, and Mobile-Review.Com all have head-to-head comparison reviews of the two).  In summary: As far as camera phones go, these are as good as you get; they are both comparable to mid-range pocket cameras.  The k850i has an advantage indoors, because it has a real Xenon flash in addition to the LED autofocus assist beam.  However, in general, it has more "washed out" color reproduction than the more vivid N95; and it only supports video recording in QVGA (320x240) resolution compared to the N95 VGA (640x480).The main difference between the phones lie in other areas. The N95 is a Symbian smartphone, and so can run a whole slew of native applications specifically written for this platform, while the k850i is limited to running generic Java (j2me) mobile applictions.  Also, the k850i does not have a built-in GPS (but using an external bluetooth GPS receiver together with free GPS navigation software such as AmazeGPS, you can get voice navigation on this phone as well).  The Java version of Google Maps (which is what you would use on the k850i) has a "My Location" feature that uses information from cell phone towers to pinpoint ROUGHLY where you are, within a couple of miles; similar to the iPhone.  Various other limits exist in the k850i as well (1000 phonebook entries, 5 alarms, etc..)On the other hand, the k850i does have a few built-in applications that are notably absent from the N95: A flashlight application (uses the LED autofocus beam), mouse/keyboard emulation to control your bluetooth-enabled computer (e.g. for presentation), and a stopwatch/timer app.One last thing to note about the K850i:  Although it uniquely supports both U.S. and International 3G frequencies, its use on the AT&T; wireless network is sub-optimal.  That's because there is an interoperability issue with its built-in media player and the MEdiaNet configuration - so streaming internet videos (e.g. from YouTube) does not work.  This was the single most important reason why I ended up returning my k850i to the local store where I bought it, after having had it for about 2 weeks.N95 vs. the Samsung G810========================The Samsung G810 was announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February; it is another Symbian S60 phone with a feature set almost identical to the N95.  It will be sold internationally starting this fall; probably not in the U.S. though -- it is lacking the GSM 850 MHz frequency used here. (In other words, it is only a "tri-band" phone).  Maybe they plan on releasing a US version as well - I guess that depends on whether a carrier picks it up or not.Other than that, for better or worse the G810 has a 3x optical zoom. "Worse" because that inevitably leads to compromises in the optics (the thickness of the phone is the same, so that must mean that the CCD sensor is smaller - meaning more noise).  On the upside, it does have Xenon flash and a protective lens cap.Early available specs also indicate that it will have 96MB of RAM - midway between the N95-1 and subsequent N95s; however, the RAM will be split up into a 32MB chunk for the DSP (GSM and W-CDMA radios) and 64MB for the Symbian phone OS/functionality.  Thus, this could become an issue.For now, anther Samsung, the G600, although not available for sale in the US, seems to have a better camera (in some reviews outperforming the N95 and k850i), as well as quad-band GSM support.  (It is otherwise a low-end phone though, without e.g. 3G).UPDATE: Other Nokia Phones==========================Since the N95, several other N-series and E-series phones have been released by Nokia with very similar feature sets.  For instance, the N82, which features a full Xenon flash, and thus doubles nicely as a pocket camera also for indoor use (though the only version available does not support North American 3G bands, just like the N95-1 and N95-2).UPDATE Dec 1, 2008: The N95 now has a couple of worthy successors, each of which improve on its feature set in different ways: TheN85and theN96.  Personally, I'll stick to the N95 8GB though (see my N85 review to see why).

Various third party applications (e.g. Google Maps for S60) support its built-in GPS as well.* 3.5G (HSDPA) connectivity (see note about models below), This gives clearer voice and much faster data downloads (theoretically up to 3.5 Mbps; in practice I have seen from 900 Kbps to about 2.2 Mbps, depending on location and time of day).* WiFi (802.11g) with WEP, WPA/WPA2, and EAP/802.1x authentication (for corporate environments)* Support for nearly every Bluetooh profile in existence: A2DP for stereo audio, DUN for tethering the phone's internet connection with a laptop (for on-the road use), OBEX to send/receive files and browse the internal filesystem from a computer.* 3.5mm headset jack, infrared port w/send/receive utility, FM tuner.* "Dual slider" design: Slide display up to reveal numeric keypad; and down to reveal four multimedia buttons (Play/Pause, stop, rewind, fast forward).  Sliding it down also changes the display orientation from portrait to landscape; sliding it up switches it back.* Symbian S60 smartphone OS: In addition to thousands of available generic Java (J2ME) mobile applications, there are also nearly an equal number of native applications that can access additional functionality/hardware on the phone (for instance, there is one that uses the built-in accelerometer to control your computer's mouse cursor by simply tilting the phone, and another one that uses the built-in GPS to "geotag" pictures with your location as you use the camera).* Built-in applictions include QuickOffice to read Microsoft Office files (DOC, PPT, XLS), Adobe Acrobat Lite reader (PDF), RealPlayer (most media files/streams), home screen "Search" applet to search the Internet and local content, various organizer apps (clock w/unlimited alarms, phonebook with unlimited entries, calendar w/unlimited meetings, todos, memos, reminders..), calculator, unit converter -- you get the picture.  Notably absent, though, is a Timer/Stopwatch application; however you can easily download a third party one (e.g. from Smartphoneware).* Other S60-specific applications include Nokia's Internet Radio to stream live radio streams, "RotateMe" to automatically rotate the screen depending on your phone orientation, "Fring" mobile Skype/AIM/MSN/Google Talk/etc.. client, Google Maps with GPS support, Google home screen search applet, Mobile Weather app, "ExtGPS" to share the internal GPS information over bluetooth (e.g. to theNokia N800 Internet Tablet), YouTube player, emTube (also for YouTube access), etc.* One of the best mobile web browsers out there.  Based on AppleWebKit (a.k.a. KTML, the web engine used in the likes of Apple Safari and KDE Konqueror), it renders web pages "as they were meant to be".  And unlike that other phone that claims to do the same, the N95 also has a built-in Flash Lite player - so web pages that use flash will work as well.  Plus, you are of course free to download and use other browsers, such as the excellent, super-fast and bandwidth-saving Opera Mini (operamini.com).* Mail client with POP-3 and IMAP support (including IMAP-IDLE, a.k.a. "push mail"; alternatively it can poll at specified intervals).* Mac OS X users: Although the phone does not come with bundled software for Mac OS X, you can download "Nokia Multimedia Transfer" (to synchronize photos and music with iPhoto and iTunes) and an iSync plugin (to synchronize the address book, calendar, todo etc) with your Mac - both from Nokia's web site.  Also, setting up your Mac to access the Internet via the phone (providing that you have a data plan, e.g. the $15/month "MEdia Net Unlimited" from AT&T;) is super-easy: When you first pair with the phone, the needed WAP/APN information is pulled automatically from your Phone's SIM card.  (Ironically, this works for nearly every phone, except Apple's own iPhone; this one has a very crippled bluetooth stack, and does also not support tethering).  UPDATE: I've learned that such tethering violates AT&T;'s Terms of Service.  Moreover, there are no  plans available for this phone (or most others) from AT&T; that specifically allow tethering.  If you do so anyway, stay under the radar, and don't abuse it - e.g. by using your cellular data plan as your main internet service.MODELS:=======There are 5 subflavors of the N95 released to date:* The original N95 (a.k.a. N95-1, a.k.a. RM-159) targeted mainly the European and Asian markets; while it had quad-band GSM (2G) support for use in nearly every country, including the USA, it had support only for the international W-CDMA (UMTS/HSDPA, a.k.a. 3G/3.5G) frequency (commonly referred to as UMTS-2100).  Nonetheless, this phone was later made available for retail in the USA as well, through Nokia's flagship stores, online site, and 3rd party retailers.  It had manual shutter lens protection (you would slide it open to start the camera), 64MB of runtime/dynamic memory (RAM), and a 900 mAh battery.  Common complaints about this phone was that it would often run out of memory when several applications were open, and that the battery life was too short.* The N95-2 (a.k.a. "N95 8GB", a.k.a. RM-320) increased the screen size from 2.6" to 2.8" (diagonal), increased RAM from 64MB to 128MB, increased the battery size from 900 mAh to 1200 mAh, removed the slider mechanism for opening the camera lens, replaced the SDHC card slot with 8GB of internal flash, and replaced the silver faceplate with an all-black design.  However, the bands supported were the same: W-CDMA 2100MHz, GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz - so although it will work fine with both AT&T; Wireless, T-Mobile USA and Rogers, it does not support 3G/3.5G network speeds in North America.  Nonetheless, as with the N95-1, Nokia has sold this phone in North America as well until just a few weeks ago; so possibly, this is the phone sold here (Unfortunately, Nokia's own sales channels do not normally make this distinction, and Amazon's product description is also somewhat lacking).  UPDATE: As the product description now clearly says, this is the N95-4 (a.k.a. N95 8GB NAM) model.* The N95-3 (a.k.a. "N95 NAM", RM-160) is the first model targeted for North America.  Most of the exterior design is similar to the N95-1 (Silver faceplate, 2.6" screen, SDHC slot), but like the N95-2, it has 128MB of RAM, a 1200 mAh battery, and no manual slider for the camera shutter.  The main reason for its existence is that it swapped the original UMTS-2100 (WCDMA) frequency for UMTS-850 and UMTS-1900, so that it would work with AT&T; Wireless's 3G/3.5G network.  Until just a few days/weeks ago, this would have been the "best" choice for US customers.* The N95-4 (a.k.a. "N95 8GB NAM", RM-421) is identical to the N95-2, except that like the N95-3, it swaps UMTS-2100 for UMTS-850/1900.  It was released just a couple of weeks ago, though, so if Amazon got their inventory of "n95 8gb" devices from Nokia prior to this, it would have been the N95-2 rather than the N95-4.  (The exterior and labeling of both is the same).  Also, the firmware revision numbers are different, so some utilities (like the "Nokia Multimedia Transfer" application and iSync plugin for Mac OS X) do not yet recognize this phone. UPDATE: The N95-4 is now fully supported by most applications, including Nokia Multimeda Transfer and iSync plugin.* The N95-5 is for Japan; it is a stripped-down version of the N95-1 (e.g. no WiFi). UPDATE: As someone commented below, it is actually for China.COMPARED WITH OTHER PHONES:==========================N95 vs. iPhone==============This is almost an irrational comparison, given how different these devices are:* The iPhone is almost entirely about "sex appeal": Polished, slim, with a large screen for viewing content, multi-touch user interface (we've all seen how to zoom in and out using finger pinches, do inertial scrolling through a list of contacts, etc).  As such, it is very big on "usability".  The N95 is not even a touch-screen device.  (Personally I actually prefer "hard" keys w/tactile feedback; having used the touch-screen based Motorola A1200 MING in the past.  Touch screens are not very good for, for example, dialing a number without looking at the screen).* The iPhone feature set is, at best, mediocre.  Yes, it has WiFi - so does a lot of other phones.  Yes, it has a "WYSIWYG" web browser; again, so do so many others (including the 3-year oldMotorola A1200 MING, another touch-screen phone by the way).  However, it lacks: 3G support, GPS, Infrared, FM Radio, decent camera functionality (no flash, video recording, etc), 3rd party application support (e.g. no Internet Radio, GPS navigation, etc), or even a usable Bluetooth stack (to do silly little things like transfer files or enable internet access for a nearby laptop while on the road).  Even the otherwise crappy Motorola RAZR line (e.g. RAZR v3xx) do most of these things. UPDATE: With the release of the iPhone 3G and the new App Store, Apple has come a long way.  It's worth pointing out though that the iPhone can still not run standard J2ME/MIDP mobile applications, only those released specifically for the iPhone through the App store.  Per the Apple Terms of Service, this means: No 3rd party web browser (e.g. Opera Mini), no voice navigation, not even something along the lines of Nokia Sports Tracker (since it uses the GPS).* The iPhone is only available with a 2-year contract from AT&T; the N95 is only available SIM-free (unlocked).In short: The iPhone is about form, the N95 (and Symbian devices in general) about function.N95 vs.Sony Ericsson K850i===========================These are the only two 5MP camera phones available for the US market.  Neither of them is offered by a carrier (AT&T;, T-Mobile, Cellular One, Rogers...), so in both cases you will pay the full price for the phone.  (The upside, of course, is that you will not need to renew your contract to get it.. :)Also, both phones (in the case of the N95, some flavors of it) support the U.S. 3G bands, in addition to being quad-band GSM phones.  The difference here is that the k850i supports all four GSM bands and all three UMTS bands at the same time, so you don't have to pick a "US" vs. "International" flavor.  Finally, both phones have built-in FM tuners - though the k850i also supports RDM to display programming information transmitted in the broadcast.Most comparisons of these phones therefore center around the camera functionality (e.g. PhoneArena.com, GSMArena.com, and Mobile-Review.Com all have head-to-head comparison reviews of the two).  In summary: As far as camera phones go, these are as good as you get; they are both comparable to mid-range pocket cameras.  The k850i has an advantage indoors, because it has a real Xenon flash in addition to the LED autofocus assist beam.  However, in general, it has more "washed out" color reproduction than the more vivid N95; and it only supports video recording in QVGA (320x240) resolution compared to the N95 VGA (640x480).The main difference between the phones lie in other areas. The N95 is a Symbian smartphone, and so can run a whole slew of native applications specifically written for this platform, while the k850i is limited to running generic Java (j2me) mobile applictions.  Also, the k850i does not have a built-in GPS (but using an external bluetooth GPS receiver together with free GPS navigation software such as AmazeGPS, you can get voice navigation on this phone as well).  The Java version of Google Maps (which is what you would use on the k850i) has a "My Location" feature that uses information from cell phone towers to pinpoint ROUGHLY where you are, within a couple of miles; similar to the iPhone.  Various other limits exist in the k850i as well (1000 phonebook entries, 5 alarms, etc..)On the other hand, the k850i does have a few built-in applications that are notably absent from the N95: A flashlight application (uses the LED autofocus beam), mouse/keyboard emulation to control your bluetooth-enabled computer (e.g. for presentation), and a stopwatch/timer app.One last thing to note about the K850i:  Although it uniquely supports both U.S. and International 3G frequencies, its use on the AT&T; wireless network is sub-optimal.  That's because there is an interoperability issue with its built-in media player and the MEdiaNet configuration - so streaming internet videos (e.g. from YouTube) does not work.  This was the single most important reason why I ended up returning my k850i to the local store where I bought it, after having had it for about 2 weeks.N95 vs. the Samsung G810========================The Samsung G810 was announced at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February; it is another Symbian S60 phone with a feature set almost identical to the N95.  It will be sold internationally starting this fall; probably not in the U.S. though -- it is lacking the GSM 850 MHz frequency used here. (In other words, it is only a "tri-band" phone).  Maybe they plan on releasing a US version as well - I guess that depends on whether a carrier picks it up or not.Other than that, for better or worse the G810 has a 3x optical zoom. "Worse" because that inevitably leads to compromises in the optics (the thickness of the phone is the same, so that must mean that the CCD sensor is smaller - meaning more noise).  On the upside, it does have Xenon flash and a protective lens cap.Early available specs also indicate that it will have 96MB of RAM - midway between the N95-1 and subsequent N95s; however, the RAM will be split up into a 32MB chunk for the DSP (GSM and W-CDMA radios) and 64MB for the Symbian phone OS/functionality.  Thus, this could become an issue.For now, anther Samsung, the G600, although not available for sale in the US, seems to have a better camera (in some reviews outperforming the N95 and k850i), as well as quad-band GSM support.  (It is otherwise a low-end phone though, without e.g. 3G).UPDATE: Other Nokia Phones==========================Since the N95, several other N-series and E-series phones have been released by Nokia with very similar feature sets.  For instance, the N82, which features a full Xenon flash, and thus doubles nicely as a pocket camera also for indoor use (though the only version available does not support North American 3G bands, just like the N95-1 and N95-2).UPDATE Dec 1, 2008: The N95 now has a couple of worthy successors, each of which improve on its feature set in different ways: TheN85and theN96.  Personally, I'll stick to the N95 8GB though (see my N85 review to see why).

Clear, loud enough to hear in the wind...I walk quite a bit and there is a lot of noise but people don't seem to hear it too much w/ this.I have tiny ears but my husband figured out how to wear the smallest size...it comes with several sizes for the actual bud that goes in your ear.It is light and convenient, I love the carry/charging caseIt is also very handy and easy to use.I keep in my car as I am notorious for NOT charging....anything =+(...and this helps keep me in line as I can carry in purse, eyeglass case, car, pocket etc. and keep it charged ....oh, you can't wear it too well w/ certain hats as they will rub against it and it will start to loosen up up and move about in your ear.But  all bluetooths seem to do that.This is the one bluetootht I finally actually use after years of hating and usually not wearing one...put phone on speaker to drive hands free all those years ....OOPS!Not anymore!!

reviewText: I have gone through at least 8 bluetooth headsets.  This is by far the best that I have found.  The sound quality is excellent from both ends; the comfort is the best that I have found over all others.  The earpiece is a soft rubbery piece that has a very soft, flexible extension that holds the earpiece in by the slight overlap of the natural ear cartelidge with very slight pressure.  While it might be uncomfortable to some if you were to leave it in for three or more hours; it is by far the best design I have found to date.  It also is the only headset that is held in perfect position by the earpiece; keeping the microphone end pointed perfectly toward the mouth at all times.  The only con that I have found is wind noise, in high-wind situations.  Something that could be easily fixed by a foam microphone cover if they would make one.  Even without this, it's still better on wind noise than all the other headsets that I have owned.  I have owned many Motorola headsets, the Jabra BT8040, the Samsung WEP200; and the Plantronics 510 Voyager.  While the battery life is not as good as some, (rated at 5 hours of talk time); Plantronics took what I think is the optimal solution by providing a battery in the charging case which provides another complete charge of an additional 5 hours without having to connect the headset to an external power source.  This gives you a usable 10 hours of talk time without bulking up the size of the headset to hold a much larger battery.

reviewText: I have had this bluetooth headset for about a year now and like the natural voice sound production and build quality. I have never had any issues with syncing the device to any of the phones that I have paired it with. Compared to the other bluetooth headsets that I have (Samsung WEP200, Motorola H375) I would say it pairs slower than the others and has similar overall sound quality. I get a tiny bit less static from the Samsung but a more natural voice sound. I have not had complaints about either headset from callers. I do like the +/- volume rocker on the Samsung more. The Samsung is also smaller and more comfortable to wear for extended periods (for my ears anyways). At about half the purchase price, I would say the Samsung is a better value than this Plantronics headset. Still, if you are willing to pay for the better sound this is a very good headset to consider.

reviewText: There's not much to say that hasn't already been said so I'll make this short. This is my second Bluetooth headset. The Motorola H700 was the first and I really liked it.Pros:* Good sounding audio. Very clear and sharp.* People hear me very well and don't know I'm on a headset until I tell them.* Noise cancellation works well. Did the dog barking test and it passed.* It's comfortable to wear.* Very lightweight.* Carrying case that doubles as a charger is excellent.* Not bad looking.* Easy to pair and Plantronics has a great tutorial online if you need help. [...]* Makes it easy to wear glasses since it doesn't have the earloop.Cons:* For those who wear it while driving like I do and have a nice stereo in their car it dampens the audio from the ear you're wearing it in. The Motorola H700 did not do that because it fit on the ear and not in it. Of course this only applies to when you're not actually on a call.* Buttons are small.* Charging connector is small and directional and therefore difficult to insert at times.Overall I think it's a great headset and Amazon has buy far, the best prices. I think you'll be happy with it.

reviewText: The auto charger I purchased with my mobile phone from the vendor's brick and mortar store went bad after a year of use; first it wouldn't recharge the phone (but would power it), and eventually it would neither recharge nor power the phone.While there is apparently little to differentiate auto chargers for mobile electronics, the iGO has unique flexibility that make it worth considering over others:-First are the interchangeable charging tips. Buy a single charger, and it accommodates a variety of swappable charger form factors (I also purchased charging tips or an iPod Nano and my phone).-Add an iGo PS00272-0001 Power Splitter, and you get the flexibility of being able to charge two devices at the same time.

reviewText: One of the known problems with theBlackBerry Storm 9530 Phone, Black (Verizon Wireless)is that using Bluetooth voice-command dialing can lock up the phone, requiring one or more reboots (remove the battery, wait 15 seconds, replace the battery, and wait 4-6 minutes). Many of my Storm problems were resolved by a Verizon support tech who had me use a command to "wipe" the device and start over again. I thought I'd start clean and use this headset instead of my Motorola, which is recommended by the Storm manual; the lock-up problem is better, but the phone still locks up occasionally.This headset fits more securely than my oldMotorola H700 Bluetooth Headset, but it takes considerably more pressure to press the control, and there is a longer delay between pressing the control and getting any response on the Storm. However, since it does seem to cause fewer lock-ups, I'll continue to use this BlackBerry headset.

reviewText: I am iPhone 3G user. I love the iPhone. I had a cheap Motorola H375 BT earpiece that worked just fine except it wasn't very comfortable in my ear and fell out easily. It sounded good though.I used to own a Blue Ant Speakerphone. It was great! It had a great battery life and worked perfectly right up to the day it "buzzed" and just died. I got a lot of usage from it and I was left with a favorable opinion of the company even though it just went kaboom one day.I am a self professed gadget freak. Ok, there I said it.When I saw the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset and read about it's features I just knew it was for me. Initially it was to expensive but when I saw it on Amazon for $79 I figured I couldn't go wrong.ROFL!Okay, I always try and give new gadgets a fair trial before recommending it to my friends or clients or giving up on it. I have now been using the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset exclusively since December 2009.It is simply the most frustrating Bluetooth earpiece I have ever used! After 3 weeks I turned off the voice prompts & speech recognition. It announces the CallerID for incoming calls but it's seems to take forever to finish what it wants to say BEFORE you can answer the phone.If the earbud isn't perfectly aligned with you ear you will just tick off people if you call or answer them as they can't hear anything you are saying. This is especially prevalent in the car. (2003 Ford Expedition EB, a somewhat quite car)It really has trouble coordinating things with the iPhone 3G. Calling out, no problem, It uses the earpiece just fine. Go to answer a call... Not so much, it selects the iPhone and you manually have to select the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset on the iPhone menu. Okay before I get a bunch of replies, YES I DID TRY "THIS AND THAT". It just didn't work properly consistent if at all on the inbound calls.Okay, with all of this, I still continued to try the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset but I have now given up on it.Perhaps I will just put it on my bookshelf and marvel at the technology that allows all this functionality in such a small form factor. I guess I'd be more amazed if it actually worked.Pros:Comfortable and stays put on my ear.Volume level is decentGooG-411 built in and is hard coded into the speech recognitionCons:It sucks.Poor audio fidelityNot iPhone friendlyIt sucks.Battery life not to good.Really Bright blinking while on. (This can be deactivated but likes to come back on)It sucks.In case I wasn't clear, I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.I hope you find this review useful as I too read these reviews myself when I am about to purchase products, like the new Bluetooth headset I am going to buy now. Let the research begin!~e

reviewText: Over the years I have owned no less than 10 bluetooth headsets, and they have all eventually had critical flaws.  I have a strangely shaped ear, and even when I find a headset that works beautifully, too often it simply doesn't fit my ear properly (previous Jabra "over the ear" style headsets, for example).  TheJabra EXTREME Bluetooth Headsetis so far the best headset that I have used.  Other previous headsets includePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset,Plantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headset, andPlantronics Pulsar 590A Headset,Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset, as well as headsets from Apple and previous over-the-ear units from Jabra like theJABRA BT2020.Here's how I'd score the Jabra EXTREMEFit & Finish5/5 stars.  Even the packaging is impressive.  I expected to hear angels sing in the background when I popped open the packaging (not quite like opening an Apple product, but close).  The headset is encased in a plastic "display stand" with all of the documentation and charging accessories included below the charging stand.  The quality of all the components appears to be top-notch, with no obvious plastic seams or burrs, no weird molding aberrations, and nice smooth, shiny surfaces.  The buttons function smoothly, but with enough feedback to let you know they have been activated (MUCH better than the Plantronics units I have used in the past).  This unit ranks right up there with the Apple BT headset in terms of fit & finish.Size/Weight5/5/ stars.  The lightest most comfortable headset I have used which actually functions well (I have used other that feel more comfortable, but their performance was unacceptable.  This unit is tiny and very light weight.  Placing it in your ear (without the ear hook) it it is able to "suspend" itself in position because it is so light weight."Wearability" - comfort4.5/5 stars.  The included "behind the ear" hooks are typically very popular, but I find them uncomfortable. This is why I have historically preferred larger "over the ear" type headsets like thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [Retail Packaging] or thePlantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headset.  However, this headset comes with the option of a tiny rubber hooked insert that fits inside the folds of your ear.  I was skeptical at first, but because of the light weight of the unit, it works extremely well.  I find that I can walk around, bend down, lean over, and even jog without the unit dislodging from my ear.  Because the hooked ear gel is so soft, it is a universal fit, and I would imagine it will fit even hard-to-fit ears (like mine).Performance/sound quality4/5 stars.  I'm still not convinced that this is the *best* headset for sound quality (I think the Voyager Pro may be better) but the iPhone is notoriously lousy with respect to Bluetooth in general, so it may be more of an issue with my phone while I've been testing this headset than the headset itself.  For what it's worth, my Voyager Pro lasted about a year before it suddenly dropped to about 1/3 volume (permanently), making it unusable.Battery Life/Talk time5/5 stars.  As good as any other headset I have used in terms of standby and talk time.  After a week of daily use (several hours of calls per day) I have yet had the battery go dead on my.  I just charge it when I think about it, which has been every couple of days.  Some other headsets (like the Voyager Pro) actually say in your ear "battery is low"; I don't know if this one does, because it has not gotten low enough yet!  I will update this review once I run the battery all the way down.Charging options5/5 stars.  This is an area where the Jabra EXTREME really shines!  First of all, there is a STANDARD micro-USB port for charging, so no proprietary charger is needed! (are you other headset mfg's listening?!!) Included in the box is a wonderful array of charging options.  First, you have the standard wall charger which will be very similar to those you might already use for other devices such as newer Blackberry's etc.  Next, you have a really nifty little USB dongle that has a ratcheting joint, allowing it to be positioned out of the way when plugged into a USB port on your laptop (see my pictures of it plugged into my Macbook Pro).  This USB dongle converts regular USB to the micro-USB, so it can be used with ANY powersource that outputs power to a USB outlet (e.g. power inverter in your car, wall chargers, computers, etc.).  Normally you would have to pay $10 to $20 for this type of dongle, particularly one this quality.  Finally, there is even a 12v cigarette lighter plug included!  This plug has a USB output on the back, so you can use it in conjunction with the dongle to charge your headset in your car or boat.  What I love about the charging accessories, is that ALL THREE components are universal and can be used with any other Micro-USB device and interchanged with any other Micro-USB stuff.  I love it when I can consolidate the junk I have to carry on trips!Nicely done, Jabra!

reviewText: The Jabra Extreme is yet another bluetooth headset from headset specialist Jabra. It comes with pretty standard accessories: a car power adapter, a wall charger, three different eargels and two removable ear hoops. Most people should be able to get a comfortable, adequate fit.The headset features a mechanical on/off switch, separate volume +/- keys, and an action button. Charging is done via a micro USB connector; thank you Jabra for choosing a ubiquitous standard instead of inflicting yet another proprietary connector on us.The wall charger is a pretty standard micro USB charger, but the car adapter is really nifty: a combination of a small cigarette lighter adapter with female USB plug, and a clever articulated USB to micro USB adapter. Thanks to this well thought out gadget, you can charge the headset in your car without ending up with a tangled mess of wires.The headset itself is very lightweight and you can wear it for extended periods of time without any inconvenience. And that's a great thing, because the battery life on this thing is fantastic. Jabra claims 5 1/2 hours of talk time, and I had no problems reaching that (no, not in one sitting, sheesh!). The stand-by life is a spectacular 10 days, and I assume if you turn off the power when you don't need it you could go on for months without having to recharge it.Bluetooth functionality is top-notch: the Extreme can pair with up to 8 devices and be connected to two of them simultaneously. Connections establish very quickly, and the audio is remarkably interference-free, unlike most of my other bluetooth headsets which can get staticky when the phone is not in direct line of sight of the headset. According to the manual it even supports A2DP (hifi stereo over bluetooth) which can be useful if you want to listen to radio over your headset -- although this feature is more at home on a stereo headset.Audio quality is absolutely unbelievable. I made a call from my car with the radio at a regular volume and the person I was talking to only heard my voice. I had to crank the radio all the way up before they were able to hear it. I made another call from the car in while it was raining heavily and the other party could hear only my voice loud and clear.So, is it perfect? Pretty close. I would like to see it ship with a few more choices of gels and earloops, and a carry case or a necklace like the one Plantronics bundles with their headset. These minor quibbles aside, I have to say this is by far the best bluetooth headset I've ever used, and I've used a lot of them.PROS----- Spectacular audio quality, no interference, noise elimination works even better than advertised- Tiny and lightweight- Simple, well positioned controls with tactile feedback- Uses standard microUSB charging connector- Mechanical on/off switch- Amazing battery life- Well designed car chargerCONS----- limited choice of included eargels and earloops- no bundled carry caseUnder its deceivingly ordinary looks, the Jabra Extreme hides an exceptionally well engineered headset that manages to deliver more than the marketing hype. Very highly recommended.

reviewText: I have used a number of Bluetooth headsets in the past (Motorola H700, LG HBM-730, Jabra BT-350, Plantronics Explorer 320, Motorola HS850, and Jabra BT-250), but I had larger given them up in favor of myMotorola T305 Bluetooth Portable Car Speaker(see my review).  However, Bluetooth headsets have come a long way in the last two and a half years so I decided that it was worth having a look at the Jabra EXTREME.  I base my evaluation of the Jabra EXTREME on the following criteria:  pairing, sound quality, ease of use, comfort, and extras.Pairing:  This is an area that headset makers (and Bluetooth device makers in general) have improved over the years.  After completing the initial charge the headset automatically goes into pairing mode when turned on as indicated by the purple/blue sequence of the indicator light.  All I had to do was have myBlackBerry Curve 8330 Phone, Silver (Verizon Wireless)(see my review) search for new Bluetooth devices.  It found the Jabra EXTREME without issue, and the two were paired after punching in the standard "0000" code.Sound Quality:  I had pretty high expectations for the EXTREME based on the product description.  However, I didn't find it to be substantially better than my prior Jabra headsets or my Motorola speakerphone.  On my end, callers sounded as clear as they do when not using a headset.  This is not groundbreaking though.  Unfortunately and to my disappointment callers reported that the EXTREME did not sound substantially different than my prior Bluetooth devices.  It seems that it is still a mystery for device makers to create a transparent experience for callers on the other end.  My wife reported the usual cut-in cut-out crackling as I would begin to and finish talking.  I would have expected more based on both the midrange price point and the technological advancements.Ease of Use:  This was the area where I noticed the most progress over prior Jabra devices.  Jabra has realized that a separate power button is a necessity.  I never liked having to hold down the multi-function button for an extended period to power devices on and off.  I would either fail to turn the device on or wind up redialing the last number called rather than turning it off.  The multi-function button is also more tactile in being both smaller yet more pronounced in the amount it is raised from the surface.  The one area users may have trouble with is the volume buttons.  These are fairly small, and users with bigger fingers could find them hard to operate.  However, I found the default volume to be sufficient for my liking so this was a non-issue.  Your mileage may vary.  One final note, the included instruction manual is quite brief.  While it is sufficient for getting started, users may have to go online to get the detailed manual if they run into any problems.  This is a cost saving measure, but it may frustrate Bluetooth neophytes.Comfort:  Jabra has gone out of their way to accommodate a variety of users by including two different sized earhooks along with left and right eargels designed for "hookless" use.  While the variety is thoughtful, the earhooks are a pretty major failure.  Their makeup is similar to the sock hangers used to hang up a pair of dress socks in a department store.  However, the earhooks may actually be less flexible than the sock hangers.  Unless one of these earhooks happens to fit the shape of your ear perfectly, you are not likely to find the earhook a viable option.  At this point I was rather concerned as I had never used a headset without an earhook.  So I changed out the default eargel for the right eargel and situated the EXTREME in my right ear.  I was pleased that it fit fairly comfortably and securely.  I shook my head up and down as well as left and right, but the headset never hinted at falling out.  I even jumped up and down to try to force it loose, but it didn't budge.  I have found this manner of wearing to be sufficiently comfortable during commutes of 30-60 minutes.  However, I left it in for a little over two hours when working from home one morning, and I exceeded the limits of comfort.  While it didn't bother me prior, my ear was quite sore once I removed the headset.  It did not linger, and two hours might be beyond the reasonable amount of time to expect to wear a headset in comfort anyway.Extras:  This is another area where Jabra was quite thoughtful.  In addition to the variety of wearing options, Jabra has included both wall and car chargers for the EXTREME.  The car charger is actually in two pieces with a USB connector.  This allows for the adapter to also be used in a PC USB port.  Given the midrange pricing of the EXTREME, users will expect some level of extras, and it is good that Jabra included these.Conclusion:  The Jabra EXTREME is a competent Bluetooth headset, but it doesn't quite set itself apart as much as its description might suggest.  If you are already happy with another Bluetooth headset, you will be better served waiting until it is time for a replacement.  Users in the market for a new headset will find that the EXTREME performs sufficient for inclusion in the midrange class of headsets.  If you have demanding requirements for sound quality, you may be better off going into the upper tier of headsets from other manufacturers such as Jawbone.  Please feel free to ask questions in the comments section below.

reviewText: Jabra Extreme is very low profile and good looking headset with some great qualities, strongest being very good noise cancellation. I tried it with iPod Touch 2G, iMac & Motorola Droid. It's PROS & CONS are as follows.PROS1. Excellent noise suppression: the party at other end could not hear loud blaring music or wind noise.2. Low profile.3. Nice finish and construction quality.4. Good ergonomics with well placed controls.5. Can pair 8 devices to this headset, and connects to 2 simultaneously.6. Very clear sound.7. Easy to pair: I paired with Motorola Droid, iPod Touch 2G and iMac without any hitch.8. Ubiquitous mini USB charger, and the headset comes with both car and wall charger.9. Automatic adjustment of volume.10. Comes with two ear gels (one for each ear) and ear hooks.11. Long lasting battery charge.12. Range of about 20 feet.13. You can receive and reject calls. I have not tried voice dialing.14. Works flawlessly with Skype on iMac (but not on iPod Touch).15. Comes with wall and car charger although micro USB cable is very short. But retractable micro USB cables are not very expensiveAmzer Micro USB Retractable Data Cable (Black).CONS1.  Sometimes it does not connect automatically on turning it on, with Droid or iPod Touch and I have to go into Bluetooth settings to establish the connection. This happens about 20-30% of time and for me is the biggest glitch in this headset.2.  Relatively expensive because you can get Bluetooth headsetsMotorola H270 Bluetooth HeadsetandMotorol H500 Bluetooth Headset (Silver) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging] for about twenty bucks. And you can get stereo New Samsung  WEP870 Mono + Stereo BT Headset for thirty five bucks.3.  Cannot fast forward or skip music tracks. This headset is made mainly for the cell phones. Although you can use it with MP3 players like iPod touch, it lacks the music navigation capabilities found in many stereo A2DP headsets/headphones.4. Takes a minute or two to fit it in the ear, but very comfortable once it is placed. After a while, you forget that you are wearing headset.5. Comes with big clear plastic storage box, what is needed is really a small pocketable storage bag.6. There are some other glitches and I am not sure who is at fault there, the headsets or the gadget or app software. For example it works great with Motorola Droid phone part but not the Music app that comes with the phone, an app called Recorder (just the microphone) and sometimes not even with Listen, the Google podcast app. Similarly with iPod Touch: works fabulously with music and podcasts but the Jabra Extreme microphone does not work with Skype & Recorder apps. So far, I have been unsuccessful in fixing these snags by playing around with settings.7. The earhooks keep falling off and are easy to loose. A pack extra gels and hooks is avilable only at the JABRA website for ten bucks with ten buck shipping!Except for these glitches, this is one of the best Bluetooth headsets I have used when it comes to noise cancellation. Although there are other less expensive Blutooth headsets, I am not sure if they have such good noise suppression and clarity of sound that thisJabra EXTREME Bluetooth Headsethas.

reviewText: This Plantronics "CT14 Cordless Headset Phone" works well and was remarkably easy to setup. We bought this for my mother to use when taking orders or providing phone consultation for her small business. She needed a comfortable headset and a lightweight phone body since her calls can last upwards of an hour and she needs her hands free while using the computer or checking inventory. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Great Sound Quality; provides crisp and clear sound on both the earpiece and mic+ Good Range; covers all of her work area+ Long Battery Life; while it will likely decrease with time, it does last a very long time before needing to be recharged+ Comfortable; the headset and phone unit are very light and can be worn for hoursCons -- Low Ringer Volume; even on it's highest setting, it can be hard to hear when set in the base- Mild Interference; when the base is set too close to our computer speakers, a loud humming could be heardThis was a good solution for our needs and will be very pleased if it lasts as long as the other Plantronics equipment we use in our shop (5 years and still going strong)!Recommended!CFH

reviewText: I got this as a replacement to my ATT Tilt. I also have a Sony W880i which I really like. I picked this one up for slightly below $600. While the build quality on this phone is fantastic compared to the ATT Tilt, in all other respects it is almost identical to the Tilt, albeit with a much better screen.I also have an itouch, and I have to say the itouch multimedia capabilities really blows my Xperia out of the water! I am mentioning the itouch here since I guess that is what the iphone must be like as well.The problem here is the Windows mobile OS which has a terrible touch screen interface. Also, my phone requires rebooting on a daily basis especially if I browse the web.Overall there is nothing wrong with this phone. If you're looking for a great Windows Mobile phone this is probably the best. However, with other smart phone choices such as Blackberry, Nokia and iphone I am not sure the OS here holds up to the competition. This phone like my Tilt has great stats on paper, but the implementation is what really matters and that is where Microsoft has let the product down.Just to be clear, I am not a Sony or MSFT basher. I love most of my sony products - and I own a lot of them, but this isn't really worth it to me and I would not recommend this to anyone who is willing to look at a non MSFT Smartphone OS.

reviewText: I have owned my ZN5 for THREE years and I still love it! The antenae and reception are excellent. This phone is reliable: I never drop a call, even in the very rural area I live in. Of course the camera is very good, too. Texting and SMS is fast and easy with T9. The internet(WAP), organizer, alarms, calendar, voice memos, and to-do list, are all easy to use and convenient. I have LOVED the MP3 player. The MP3 player sounds really good. It holds so many albums and the sound is fabulous. I use the OEM stereo ear buds that came with the phone and enjoy every minute of every song. I have an 8GB micro SD card in mine and it works perfectly.I have not had any of the problems some of the other users have experienced, except for a loose battery. So I folded a little paper and placed it on top of the battery, replaced the cover and solved that problem. I've dropped it many times and the only thing I've had to do is to make sure the battery was still making a good contact.It gets sluggish/weird if the memory is full of texts, music, or pictures or if the call logs are really long. All I've done is to very easily delete multiple texts, call logs and move my photos to the computer. EASY!I feel bad for the others who haven't had as good an experience as I have. I would definitely buy another one. Other phones my family and I've loved from T-Mobile are the Samsung T349, Motorola 490, and the Samsung Vibrant.

reviewText: I never thought I'd write a review for a USB cable, until a no-name 99 white cable I was using burned up on me in my car while charging myJabra SP700 Bluetooth Speakerphonevia thePowerjolt Dual Universal USB Micro ChargerI have plugged into my center console's 12V power jack.I don't know what the current demand was of the speakerphone battery, nor do I know what max amperage of the cheap white cable was rated at versus this BlackBerry cable, but this cable is definitely thicker and hopefully won't suffer a similar demise. The Powerjolt charger puts out a claimed 1A per port, which is quite a healthy amount of juice for your typical itty bitty USB cables.The micro USB end of the cable isn't too fat to prevent it from connecting with the Jabra nor myPlantronics Savor M1100 Bluetooth Headset(some bulkier USB ends had interference problems with plugging in to the Jabra charging port.My one criticism of this cable is that there's nothing molded into the plugs or stenciled on the cable to indicate that it is in fact a genuine RIM / BlackBerry product. Not that that matters one bit to me so long as it doesn't light my car on fire -- and so far, so good.

reviewText: I found that many adapters and power supplies had microSD connectors that were too big to fit into my new Samsung S5570 Galaxy Mini Android phone - the female plug inside the phone is recessed in such a way that the male connector must have a very slim housing to fit.  After ordering a few from Amazon and having none of them fit, I started visiting phone shops trying to find *anything* that would work.  I finally found one that fit, at an AT&T retail store.  They had three in stock at $20 each.  It was in an AT&T branded box but the cable was made by Belkin.  Anyway, I wanted five of them to keep at various places where I might want to sync and/or charge my phone, so that would have been $100 plus tax.  Compare that to the roughly $6 I paid for five of these here on Amazon.  And these aren't charge-only cables, they will both charge and connect your phone to your computer via USB.  If you're looking to charge/connect a Samsung with a microSD, stop looking and buy this.

reviewText: If you want this phone because of the supposed IMAP client, you might be disappointed.  There are other problems too, but I'll start with the long one.If you have it already, and set up your email by following all of the menu prompts, you might like it just fine without realizing what it is actually doing.The way life ought to work, and does on other phones:If you have an IMAP email phone, and an email service which supports IMAP, you get free "push" email (instant delivery, not waiting for the next dial-up) with no extra charge beyond your data plan.  Very simple.Nokia doesn't seem to care.  There is an option for email alerts, but it doesn't seem to actually work unless you agree to the terms of their new "Nokia Messaging" service.  Instead of the phone connecting directly with your email provider (eg, GMail), the phone installs the Nokia application which connects with Nokia's server, and that server at Nokia is actually connected with your email provider.  Not only is this a ghetto work-around, but if you read the terms of the service, it is only free until Nokia decides they are done "testing" it and want to charge you money.So you might be happily using what you think is IMAP push email on this phone, and for all we know it could stop working next month and Nokia could demand that you pay their subscription fee... for something which ought to just work anyway.No pretend that this doesn't matter to you, or you think I am nuts, etc.  On to the next problem.If your email provider has IMAP available, the phone will not allow you to set it to download whole email messages.  The setting option which allows either "headers only" or header+body when you use POP3 is neutered when you have an IMAP server address, and the only option is headers only.  So if you look at your phone and see several new emails, every time you click on it you have to wait for it to connect and load the email.  My SonyEricsson w595 is not so stupid.  I have instant IMAP delivery, and get the body text automatically.So forget about the email client, what about other Internet applications?Here's two problems with that stuff:1. You can't turn off the menu option which stupidly asks if you really want to allow a web browser to access the Internet... every single time you use it.  Other phones at least skip this if you installed a signed application (eg, Opera or Bolt browsers).  The popup has no "never ask" option, and there is no setting for it from the application manager either.  Only Nokia's own browser is exempt.2. The fancy e63 also lets you select an "access point" every time you do something which requires Internet access.  This would be a great feature if you use both WiFi and cellular, and want to switch back and forth all the time.  But it's a total annoyance if you don't.  The e63 lets you turn this "feature" off for its own web browser, but it still does it for everything else.  Google maps, Bolt browser, GMail application... every one makes you select the access point every time you use it.

reviewText: The original battery in my bb8900 stopped holding charge after almost 2 years.  I have replaced it with this battery that I purchased from  BTO, Inc, and now my phone can go 2+ days wihout recharge.One note about the little water exposure sticker.  This battery has an absolutely white sticker, but the sticker on the original battery had a pink line from the time I bought BB8900 from T-Mobile.  Some have commented that pink line means the battery has been exposed to water, but I don't think so because my original battery had the pink line since it was brand new.  Regardless, the battery works and at the price I am completely satisfied with it.

reviewText: A very clever solution if you have a mini digital camera.  Super convenient as you don't have to remove the camera from the case. It's a wrap! Just unhook the Velcro, and you are ready for a snap.It works by utilizing the tripod socket under the camera. It doesn't matter if socket is at the center or off center, it is very easy to adjust. After making sure that the camera is tightly secured, then you wrap it like a burrito :) It will be open to the sides, but it will still be completely protected as the material extends beyond the length of the camera.One disadvantage is that you have to remove the case if you want to mount the camera to a tripod. Usually not the case for a small pocket point-and-shoot camera.  Also, it would be a great plus if it has a mini-pocket for additional memory card or battery.The wrap is black and elegant. Made of quality stretchable material. Made in China.This is one of the cheapest and most effective solutions to protect a small camera.  Perfect companion for my Fuji J28.

reviewText: Was skeptical when I read the raves about this newPlantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headsetwhen it was first announced. Am a heavy cell phone user, and spend quite a bit of time on the road and in environments where I need a good and reliable hands-free solution for communication. There have been a number of Bluetooth headsets released in many different price ranges over the past few years, and I've bought many of them, some of which now sit uselessly in the bottom of my electronics drawer.But this time the raves were right, as in my opinion, it's tuned out to be the best one on the market to date. Read on and you'll see why I came to this conclusion.First Impressions:Upon arrival, opened it immediately, as I had a good test scenario in which to use it the following day: walking around a noisy outdoor flea market. The packaging was excellent, and found immediately that the instruction manual was written in a very clear and concise fashion, with easy-to-follow text and good illustrations. Followed the directions and charged the unit for the suggested 30 minutes before first use.As it was charging, looked carefully at the new Bluetooth headset and immediately thought that it might be uncomfortable, as the battery pack portion which rests behind the ear appeared larger than many on the market. I also wear glasses, and didn't think that it would be at all comfortable. Found later that I was quite wrong in both cases.After its initial charge, tried to see how easy it might pair with my often-stubborn cell phone, and exercise that has sometimes required a few tries. The Plantronics Voyager PRO paired up on the very first try, which was a first for this user. Found that the standard medium ear tips were a perfect fit, and then tried each of the additional ones that came with the unit, settling back to the original. I wear my Bluetooth headsets on the left side, and found it easy to change in seconds by rotating the boom mike. After all of this was done, finished charging the headset for the suggest 1.5 hours to full charge.Trial Run:The following day was a Saturday when I was going to be visiting a busy outdoor flea market with a friend, and it seemed to be the perfect time to test the unit. The noise levels were as expected, so I tried making a few calls using free weekend minutes. The first thing that people with whom I was talking noticed was that the sound was so clear, better than they had ever heard from my previous calls, and this was even with a moderate wind blowing at times. Most thought that I was still home.Wore the headset into the early afternoon, a little over eight hours straight, and found it to be the most comfortable Bluetooth headset that I've yet to encounter... for the most part didn't even realize that it was there. Also found that it didn't interfere with wearing glasses at all, which is a strong plus for this user.Pros:* Great ergonomics, fits easily right out of the box.* Superb sound quality, even in windy conditions.* First-rate controls for power, volume and call control.* Automatic voice prompts alert battery & mute status.* Excellent and clearly written instructions.* Non-proprietary charger port (micro USB).* Up to six hours of continuous talk time, confirmed.* Single charge standby of five days..Cons:* None. Can't find a single one so far... another first.Regular Use:The Plantronics Voyager PRO has become an item that I use daily, which I couldn't say about my old Bluetooth headsets, including my old basicMotorola H505 Bluetooth Headset, which had actually served me quite well for a couple of years. The Voyager PRO is far more comfortable and ergonomic than the photos might indicate, something that one can only find by actual extended use. Have worn mine for 12+ hours a day at a time, and it's been quite easy to adapt to over extended periods of time, with no discomfort whatsoever. I ride a mountain bike some distances over suburban streets and wooded trails on a regular basis each week, and the first thing that callers notice is that the sound quality is excellent, with no wind noise reported by anyone.Suggestion:Did some checking on the Plantronics site (just google Plantronics Voyager Pro) and found that if one registered the unit, the company would send out a free car charger. The site said: "Purchase a Plantronics Voyager PRO headset and register your new product to receive a FREE power charger for your car." So I registered mine, and within about a week received it and received another pleasant surprise in that the quality of the free car charger was as good as the Voyager Pro. So be sure to register your unit if you get one of these.Summary:Have had this unit for over a month now and have subjected it to more use than the average product that I might review here. Looked carefully to see if there were any flaws or omissions in the product or its performance and for once just couldn't find a single one.Kudos to Plantronics for bringing such a product to market, for it satisfies the Bluetooth headset needs of the demanding user such as me.  A true 5-star offering, without a doubt.[UPDATED]I would have kept this Voyager PRO Headset for years, as it perfectly satisfied all of my needs, but I had an accident with the one reviewed here, so when I had to get a replacement, I decided to replace it with thePlantronics Voyager 520 Bluetooth Headset, as it had been recommended by a friend as a reasonably priced alternative. That was a mistake, putting it simply, and since then have replaced the Plantronics Voyager 520 headset with the newerPlantronics Voyager PRO+ Bluetooth Headsetearlier in 2012, and recently posted a review on it, as can be seen in the notes here. The Voyager PRO+ was a logical move considering my personal needs, though whether it's any better that the Voyager PRO remains to be seen. I'll gladly keep answering questions on the older one as much as possible, as I've been doing all along... and thanks to all of you who have tracked this review.4/17/2012

reviewText: I origionaly had the 510, that is a great headset. I was not able to hear on it any more when I went to my new phone, Samsung A877. I tried many others first and all had the same problem, sound quality was low. This one is set to one below highest but the sound is great. The wind is still heard by callers but the sound quality to them is better.

reviewText: [This is an updated review; some of the issues that existed when the N97 was first released have since been addressed.  Also, I have moved some of the more elaborate details of the original text into a new review ("A Guide") that I created for thewhite version.]Nokia E- and N-series phones have for some years now had, by far, more capabilities than anything else out there - but they have not always been the sexiest or had the widest mass appeal.  Plus, although Nokia sell more smartphones than anyone else worldwide, they have not targeted or marketed the US market very heavily (thanks in part to our combination of non-standard wireless technologies and frequencies, consumers' focus on style over substance, and Nokia's unwillingness to cater to the fairly heavy-handed branding and crippling of functionality demanded by US network providers).Much of that is changing with the N97.  As you can see it definitely has the visual appeal.  Also, its main enhancements over the most recent N-series phones (such as theN95,N96andN85) are user interface centric:>> 640x360 WVGA LCD>> Touch screen>> QWERTY keypad>> Faster CPU (ARM11 at 420 MHz vs. 332/369 MHz in the N95/N85, and two ARM9 cores at 265 MHz in the N96)>> Configurable widgets for the home screenThere are a couple of other improvements as well:>> 32GB of built-in storage, SDHC card slot for up to 32GB more (Nokia always advertise only the tested configuration, 16GB)>> Additional sensors: Magnometer (electronic compass), ProximitySo, yes, Nokia have finally bit the dust and moved onto the post-iPhone touch screen bandwagon.  But whereas Apple borrowed quite a few UI elements from theMotorola Ming, and other manufacturers in turn tried to copy the iPhone look and feel, Nokia has taken a decidely different approach: They have taken most of their new design elements from their ownInternet Tabletsline (e.g. exchangable home screen widgets, keypad layout, etc).  They have also done so while keeping the underlying OS from their previous smartphones, Symbian/S60.I don't care much for this direction.  To this day, I would take theE90any day over the N97, had it been released with support for North American 3G (UMTS) bands.  The E90 does not have a touch screen, but does have a numeric keypad on the outside in addition to the QWERTY inside the shell -- this allows you to "type" with one hand using the native T9 predictive input, and mostly keep your eyes elsewhere while dri... eh... walking.As it is, Nokia ended up with touch screen phones (starting with the 5800 XpressMusic) kicking and screaming - it kindof shows.  The user interaction paradigm is a little odd at times -- probably mostly due to the S60 legacy. [Lipstick/pig joke deliberately omitted here]. For instance:>> You need to double-tap on icons (once to select, once to open)>> They still retain "soft keys" on the side to access menus an the like (though now they are located on the display itself, and occupying quite a bit of space).  The home (previously "standby") screen has three soft keys; the left and middle are always "Options" and a a dial pad, while the right one is configurable ("Contacts") by default.There are some other usability issues with this phone as well:>> Copy & Paste functionality is a bit more cumbersome.  There are no keypad shortcuts; with the keypad open, cut/copy/paste are only available via the menus!  Moreover, not all text input screens have such a menu available - in which case you need to close they keypad in order to bring up a virtual numeric keypad with a context menu at the top of the screen.  Or, if you use an external Bluetooth keyboard, you can press Ctrl-X/C/V.>> The keypad layout is a little unusual at first.  The navigation keys are on the left (which some gamers like, but I don't).  The space bar is in an odd location on the right.  Mixed alpha/numeric input is cumbersome because the digits 0-9 are "shifted" via a key on the right side of the keyboard, while the standard shift key is on the left.  Plus, in some dialogs you get a helpful numeric keypad on your screen, but it defaults to text input (2=abc, 3=def, etc) rather than give you quicker access to digits! (Why, Nokia?  You already have the keyboard?  What are you thinking?).  That said, the tactile feedback is good, not too "firm" or "clicky", but with a good feedback.>> There is a nice E-mail status widget for the home screen, but you can only have one of these.  If you have multiple e-mail accounts (e.g. for work/home), you can only monitor one of them.  The same goes for some of the other widgets too.>> Direct media controls are gone (the N95/N96/N85 had a dual slider design giving ready access to play/pause/previous/next).  There is a home screen widget available, but it is hardly as convenient (e.g. if you are using an application, typing a mail, etc).Some other limitations that I found so far when compared to their previous N-series phones:>> The amount of available RAM (dynamic memory) available for applications is low (around 55MB, versus about 75MB in the N85/N95).  UPDATE 2009-07-01: This may not be an issue after all. With the latest firmware update from Nokia, the available memory seems to have increased to about 65MB - and in general, the only time I have had a "out of memory" error was while running RoadSync, which explicitly warns that it is not compatible with this phone.>> Adobe Reader is no longer included in the price of the phone. It is still preinstalled, but now only on a trial basis.  If you want to continue using it after some days (about 3 weeks I gather), you need to purchase it - similar to QuickOffice.>> The number of applications available for this phone is somewhat more limited; this is only the second Nokia phone to use the new S60 5th edition user interface w/touch-screen support.  Although most of the older applications will still run on it, there may be some that don't.  Notably, Nokia Internet Radio is not included,  nor is it available for download yet. :(>> Synchronization of phone contacts/events/todos is not yet supported on the Mac, as Nokia have not as of the time of this writing released an iSync plugin for it. (You can still synchronize with Microsoft Exchange, use the built-in "Switch" application to copy contacts from another Nokia phone, or you can transfer contacts as vCards from another phone).>> Getting Bluetooth Stereo Audio (A2DP/AVRCP) to work with your Bluetooth car stereo is hit and miss.  More on my experiences in this regard in the "white" model review.>> The UI is generally a bit "sluggish" - moreso than my previous phone, the Nokia N85, despite a faster processor.  The touch UI probably has a lot to do with this.  (Then again, both the N95 and certainly the N96 did not break any speed records by any stretch of the imagination).All that said, most of these issues are software/firmware related, and will improve over time.  As it is, the N97 is perhaps the most capable phone on the planet today -- a jack of all trades, if you will.  It certainly has improved over previous N-Series phones in a number of ways as well:>> E-mail reading is dramatically improved - especially in clients with HTML support (e.g. System SEVEN). Also, because most of these integrate into the "Messaging" application, messages are listed much more nicely in the mailbox -- the larger screen is used very well here.>> Web browsing - what a pleasure. This was the main attraction of the iPhone - but I think the N97 surpasses it. Kinetic scrolling, variable zoom, and quite a speed improvement.  Of course the previous strengths are there too - the way the "Back" button brings up snapshot views of your previously viewed pages, Flash, etc.>> The phone has quite a "solid" feel to it, without feeling like a tank.To be sure, there are phones out there with better cameras (e.g. Samsung Pixon), more newbie-friendly user interfaces (iPhone), better support for a variety of corporate e-mail standards (Blackberry), and so on - but hardly any that have the combination of all these features in one device.  The closest may be the close cousin Samsung Omnia HD, which:>> runs the same OS, has the same screen resolution and many other features>> has a better camera (yeah "megapixel blur" but also optics), HD video recording>> faster CPU (600 MHz vs 420 MHz)but:>> does not have good support for U.S. 3G frequencies, and>> does not have a keypad (QWERTY or otherwise).These two shortcomings pretty much kills the Omnia HD as an alternative for me.Also, aside from the N85, the N97 is the first Nokia phone to support tri-band UMTS ("worldwide" 3G).  This means that you will get 3G speeds (mostly) where they are available: 850/1900 MHz for AT&T; Wireless and other carriers in the Americas, 2100 MHz elsewhere (including Japan).  That said, for complete worldwide coverage you would need "penta-band" UMTS, with the additional inclusion of 900 MHz for Europe, and 1700 MHz for T-Mobile USA.  No phones currently support all of these bands.  NOTE: There is also a "standard" version of the N97 for international markets, with support for 900/2100 MHz internationally and 1900 MHz for roaming in the Americas.You probably won't see this phone subsidized on contract by a carrier anytime soon.  The primary candidate would be AT&T; - but it looks like they have passed on it (perhaps they don't believe it has mass market appeal).  Then again, if you are looking to get this phone, you are not likely to be the type of person who would accept their lockdowns in the first place.  Look no further than the differences between theunlocked Nokia E71versusAT&T;'s E71xfor a prime example: In AT&T;'s version, various features are disabled (keyboard shortcuts for copy&paste;, the S60 native e-mail reader, network selection), and instead a number of non-removable, non-renamable, non-movable AT&T; specific applications are installed.Another upside of buying an unlocked phone like this is that it may cost you less in the long run.  It seems I'm unable to get actual numbers past Amazon's editors here (see comments) - but if you have a standard SIM from AT&T;, you can plug it into this phone and add a standard "data unlimited" feature.  In contrast, if you get a smartphone on contract from AT&T;, your data plan will be at least twice as expensive - which adds up over the 2-year contract term to cover (at least) the price difference between most of these and the unlocked N97.  Plus, you would of course not need to renew your contract with an unlocked phone like this.  AT&T;'s generally subsidize their phones a couple of hundred bucks versus the unlocked equivalent (except the iPhone, where the subsidy is closer to four hundred, but where the more expensive data plan is mandatory).Finally, if you take your unlocked phone with you abroad, you can walk into a store and get a pre-paid SIM -- that way you local tariffs, rather than pay (outrageous!) roaming fees to AT&T.;Now for a couple of practical aspects and caveats:>> If you are looking for a unique look, go for the white model, not this black one.  Some also think it is better looking.>>If you are going to use the N97 in your car, to play music or for GPS turn-by-turn directions, do yourself a favor and get a cradle/mount for it.  For instance, there is a Brodit cradle (available from ProClipUSA) specifically designed for it; this is one part of a two-part mount, the second part will be specific to your vehicle; you can get one from either ProClipUSA, PanaVise, or Pro-Fit International - they are all compatible.  Or, if you want a universal holder, the Bracketron Grip-IT works nicely for the N97, and can also be put on the same vehicle specific mounts.Finally, if you are looking to get this phone, it is important that you get it for the capabilities, not ease of use.  Like other Symbian/S60 phones, getting used to it takes a little persistence and discovery, but it will grow on you over time as you explore it and learn more about its esoteric features.

reviewText: [This is an updated review; some of the issues that existed when the N97 was first released have since been addressed.  Also, I have moved some of the more elaborate details of the original text into a new review ("A Guide") that I created for thewhite version.]Nokia E- and N-series phones have for some years now had, by far, more capabilities than anything else out there - but they have not always been the sexiest or had the widest mass appeal.  Plus, although Nokia sell more smartphones than anyone else worldwide, they have not targeted or marketed the US market very heavily (thanks in part to our combination of non-standard wireless technologies and frequencies, consumers' focus on style over substance, and Nokia's unwillingness to cater to the fairly heavy-handed branding and crippling of functionality demanded by US network providers).Much of that is changing with the N97.  As you can see it definitely has the visual appeal.  Also, its main enhancements over the most recent N-series phones (such as theN95,N96andN85) are user interface centric:>> 640x360 WVGA LCD>> Touch screen>> QWERTY keypad>> Faster CPU (ARM11 at 420 MHz vs. 332/369 MHz in the N95/N85, and two ARM9 cores at 265 MHz in the N96)>> Configurable widgets for the home screenThere are a couple of other improvements as well:>> 32GB of built-in storage, SDHC card slot for up to 32GB more (Nokia always advertise only the tested configuration, 16GB)>> Additional sensors: Magnometer (electronic compass), ProximitySo, yes, Nokia have finally bit the dust and moved onto the post-iPhone touch screen bandwagon.  But whereas Apple borrowed quite a few UI elements from theMotorola Ming, and other manufacturers in turn tried to copy the iPhone look and feel, Nokia has taken a decidely different approach: They have taken most of their new design elements from their ownInternet Tabletsline (e.g. exchangable home screen widgets, keypad layout, etc).  They have also done so while keeping the underlying OS from their previous smartphones, Symbian/S60.I don't care much for this direction.  To this day, I would take theE90any day over the N97, had it been released with support for North American 3G (UMTS) bands.  The E90 does not have a touch screen, but does have a numeric keypad on the outside in addition to the QWERTY inside the shell -- this allows you to "type" with one hand using the native T9 predictive input, and mostly keep your eyes elsewhere while dri... eh... walking.As it is, Nokia ended up with touch screen phones (starting with the 5800 XpressMusic) kicking and screaming - it kindof shows.  The user interaction paradigm is a little odd at times -- probably mostly due to the S60 legacy. [Lipstick/pig joke deliberately omitted here]. For instance:>> You need to double-tap on icons (once to select, once to open)>> They still retain "soft keys" on the side to access menus an the like (though now they are located on the display itself, and occupying quite a bit of space).  The home (previously "standby") screen has three soft keys; the left and middle are always "Options" and a a dial pad, while the right one is configurable ("Contacts") by default.There are some other usability issues with this phone as well:>> Copy & Paste functionality is a bit more cumbersome.  There are no keypad shortcuts; with the keypad open, cut/copy/paste are only available via the menus!  Moreover, not all text input screens have such a menu available - in which case you need to close they keypad in order to bring up a virtual numeric keypad with a context menu at the top of the screen.  Or, if you use an external Bluetooth keyboard, you can press Ctrl-X/C/V.>> The keypad layout is a little unusual at first.  The navigation keys are on the left (which some gamers like, but I don't).  The space bar is in an odd location on the right.  Mixed alpha/numeric input is cumbersome because the digits 0-9 are "shifted" via a key on the right side of the keyboard, while the standard shift key is on the left.  Plus, in some dialogs you get a helpful numeric keypad on your screen, but it defaults to text input (2=abc, 3=def, etc) rather than give you quicker access to digits! (Why, Nokia?  You already have the keyboard?  What are you thinking?).  That said, the tactile feedback is good, not too "firm" or "clicky", but with a good feedback.>> There is a nice E-mail status widget for the home screen, but you can only have one of these.

reviewText: A little background first. I have used Nokia phones since 1998 and found them reliable and virtually indestructible. I decided to move to a smartphone, no Nokia models were available. My first smartphone ran winmo. It would constantly freeze up and battery life was horrible. I then got a Palm Centro and loved it! It had it's own problems (would reboot randomly and the build quality wasn't great) but overall it was a good little phone. After about 17 months it failed and I couldn't upgrade using my plan. I purchased a unlocked Nokia E63 and was back in the Nokia fold. Build quality was great. When the E72 was announced I decided to go for it. The first reviews from the blogs and tech sites were glowing so I felt good about ordering it. Then the user reviews started....Build quality problems and the "made in China" complaints made me doubt my decision. Along with other problems.... I received my E72 a little over a month ago and was disappointed in the build quality, especially the loose battery cover. In fact, I went to check out the Blackberry Bold 9700 which was on sale for $89 (after rebate)at Best Buy Mobile. I wasn't impressed with it's build quality either though. Also I was afraid of the AT&T; cripple ware that would probably be installed. So I decided to give the E72 a try. I installed my sim and booted up. Push email installed flawlessly and worked great. I suffered none of the problems other users were reporting. I figured I had lucked out and had gotten a "good" one. After a week the loose battery cover settled in and while still not a perfect fit,it was no longer loose. Then week 3 happened...The first problem occurred while attempting to place a call. The phone would let me dial a number but the call would not complete. Of course I figured it was the (AT&T;) network. I then realized I couldn't send text messages either. I did a "soft" reboot and that fixed the problem. A couple of days later, I got the dreaded "space bar doesn't work" problem. Again, a soft reboot fixed this problem. The next day while using the browser, the phone rebooted on its own. Today I got the "buzzing/squeal" problem while talking. Yet again, a restart solved the problem.In my opinion for what it's worth, I think Nokia released this phone in time for the holiday season without the proper quality control. All of these problems can be fixed by a firmware update. The N900 got one today so hopefully the E72 will receive one soon.I apologize for the long winded review. Flame on?

reviewText: This is the secondPlantronics Carry Case for Voyager Pro/Pro+ Bluetooth Headsetthat I have bought.  It's not because I love them; it's because there are a couple of design flaws of which buyers need to be aware.  First I'll touch on the good and bad, then the details.Pros:* Nice professional design, attractive and non-obtrusive* Reasonable protection for Plantronics Voyager Pro-series headsets* Compact and unobtrusiveCons:* Belt clip leaves it all too easy slip off* Magnet closure opens too easily, headset can fall outDetails:As noted above, this is the second of these cases that I've purchased, and this one only because it came as a freebie on a promotion when I purchased my replacementPlantronics Voyager PRO+ Bluetooth Headset.  My earlier one was lost when I was out cycling, and I had the case with the headset clipped to my belt.  I can say that in part this was my own fault, as I had wondered how well the belt clip on the rear would hold, but since I've had such good luck with Plantronics products over the years, I figured that they were better engineers than me.So much for blind faith... and somewhere on a +20 mile bike ride in the late afternoon, the case slipped off of my belt, so I was out one Voyager PRO+ headset and a poorly-engineered case.If you read the other reviews here, you will see that my experiences are not unique, as others have had similar experiences. All things being said, my initial being upset over the loss of the case and headset has subsided over the months that have passed, but I still look at this case very cautiously, and now relegate it to the inside of my computer case or camera bag when the headset is not in use.Any recommendations that I might offer on this would be conditional, and only if the user put it in another bag or case... and be careful, as the magnetic latch opens far too easily. The Voyager PRO+ headset is a good, solid product; it's a shame that its case is not.2/17/2012
