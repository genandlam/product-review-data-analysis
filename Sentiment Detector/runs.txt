I already had one that is essentially identical, except my old phone (Motorola V5510 has a different sytle adapter than the Razr, which uses a 'mini-USB'.This product is inexpensive, does exactly what it says, which is charges the phone in a car using the auto's power/cigarette outlet, and it comes with a cute little Motorola 'M' insignia which lights up bloue during use.  At such a low price - I paid less than $9 on AMAZON - there's really no reason to buy a non-OEM charger.", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'VERY USEFUL ACCESSORY', 'unixReviewTime': 1156377600, 'reviewTime': '08 24, 2006'}

first review: {'reviewerID': 'ARS05BZQOAAIY', 'asin': 'B002BH3I9U', 'reviewText': 'Im not sure if the pair which I received became warped or if that is how they were intended to be designed, but they do not fit well at all. They wrap around the head as advertised, but the back of the wrap hits the bottom of my neck, and the earphones are not rotated as far as they should be. this causes the forward (>>) button to be not pointing forward towards my face, but pointing down towards my chin. This strange setup also causes the headphones not to sit flat against the ears, but are awkwardly angled slightly outwards.I really hope that this was just a defected pair that I received, but based on mine I would not recommend this product to anyone with a normally sized and shaped head. Maybe Shaq would like them.', 'overall': 2.0, 'summary': 'Work fine, very uncomfortable', 'unixReviewTime': 1297209600, 'reviewTime': '02 9, 2011'}

But you've probably been bitten by a mosquito...it's the little things that get you!And it is the little things that drop my rating on this iphone charger.  The charger does charge the phone so it gets a couple stars for that.  Nitpicks that prevent the charger from rising above two stars relative to competition:-Size:  The charging unit is big and bulky (no kitchen counter for this one).-Lighting:  There is a light on the unit that is too bright.  If kept in the bedroom at night the light is distracting and had to actually be covered up.-Talk While Charging:  If your phone is dead you can't talk on the phone while it is charging from what I can tell.-Phone Cover:  You have to use the phone cover, but people report that voice sounds muffled when talking on the phone with the cover on it.-Pricey:  Expensive, there are other alternatives that perform better for lower price.", 'overall': 2.0, 'summary': "It's the little things that get you...", 'unixReviewTime': 1282176000, 'reviewTime': '08 19, 2010'}
