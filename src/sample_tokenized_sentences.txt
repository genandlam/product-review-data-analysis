B005SUHRVC	5	I got this case because everyone in my family has an iphone.  It is the best case to have in my opinion.  The two layers, one rubber, one hard plastic, work together for great protection.  I have dropped my phone outside on a brick patio and it was not damaged because of this case.  I don't ever go without it on my phone.These cases are more expensive, but you get what you pay for when it comes to a phone case.  if you're going to have a $400 phone, why wouldn't you spend $40 more to protect it?	05 9, 2014	AY8LGCP6HPLI	Great case	1399593600	"['I got this case because everyone in my family has an iphone.', 'It is the best case to have in my opinion.', 'The two layers, one rubber, one hard plastic, work together for great protection.', 'I have dropped my phone outside on a brick patio and it was not damaged because of this case.', ""I don't ever go without it on my phone.These cases are more expensive, but you get what you pay for when it comes to a phone case."", ""if you're going to have a $400 phone, why wouldn't you spend $40 more to protect it?""]"	6
B0050OJVOW	1	I realize that even the slightest piece of dust can cause a bubble so i tried applying these in the bathroom while wearing no clothes after sweeping and dusting every last inch of my bathroom. I'm not joking. I even googled special instructions on how to remove bubbles but these would just not go on right. I could not apply any of the last 3 without having bubbles under them, even in a dustless environment.Also, they are slightly too long so I had to use scissors to trim them down right.Seems like other people are having better luck than me, which is cool. I'm glad, they just did not work for me.	05 13, 2013	AVQXX3NY4F6XI	Could not get bubbles out	1368403200	"['I realize that even the slightest piece of dust can cause a bubble so i tried applying these in the bathroom while wearing no clothes after sweeping and dusting every last inch of my bathroom.', ""I'm not joking."", 'I even googled special instructions on how to remove bubbles but these would just not go on right.', 'I could not apply any of the last 3 without having bubbles under them, even in a dustless environment.Also, they are slightly too long so I had to use scissors to trim them down right.Seems like other people are having better luck than me, which is cool.', ""I'm glad, they just did not work for me.""]"	5
B0054EBOIO	4	I really do like the way this case feels, the color is a little bit off then it is in the picture, but otherwise great buy!	12 29, 2013	A1VTV90YC6NGAW	Good!	1388275200	['I really do like the way this case feels, the color is a little bit off then it is in the picture, but otherwise great buy!']	1
B00B8P8IVO	5	Lovely colors, colors are as pictures.  Nice that it comes with a stylus.  I think they should take the picture of the screen covers off, because the case does not come with a screen cover.	06 22, 2013	A2HT0CZ7JL297R	As pictured, good case for money	1371859200	['Lovely colors, colors are as pictures.', 'Nice that it comes with a stylus.', 'I think they should take the picture of the screen covers off, because the case does not come with a screen cover.']	3
B008DJH5HG	1	i bought this thinking it was cute and would protect my phone. colors are true to the picture, but the case just sucks. the blue rubberish thing goes on, then you snap on the yellow, but it will barely snap together after wrestling it for 5 mins. then you get it on, and pressing the buttons doesnt work, especially the home button. half the time you cant get it to recognize you pressing the home button, and the other half, it will automatically exit out of what youre doing thinking youve pressed it. i took the case off 10 minutes later and havent used it since	01 14, 2014	A14H25T1D9UFDZ	havent used it once	1389657600	['i bought this thinking it was cute and would protect my phone.', 'colors are true to the picture, but the case just sucks.', 'the blue rubberish thing goes on, then you snap on the yellow, but it will barely snap together after wrestling it for 5 mins.', 'then you get it on, and pressing the buttons doesnt work, especially the home button.', 'half the time you cant get it to recognize you pressing the home button, and the other half, it will automatically exit out of what youre doing thinking youve pressed it.', 'i took the case off 10 minutes later and havent used it since']	6
